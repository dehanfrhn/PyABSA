all the midrange and high brands could be found in this mall . very busy mall indeed and quiet complicated as had many sections . the $T$ decor of the mall is interesting as every floor was different . the floor with the restaurant looked european style decor . and lower basement had the food market and food court . only thing to be careful about is many eateries take card only and no cash . so check that before standing in line . .

" this $T$ mall is impressive and very , very large and you will need a couple of days to have a really good look and experience because we could not even get to see the whole mall in two days ! it is typical of the mega - malls in that it does not cater for people on a budget . many high end fashion labels and brands on the ground levels and as you ascend the escalators you start to get more affordable brands however , nothing is cheap so , do not go to this mall looking for bargains ! i did however find good buys in this mall ( according to my budget ) and i enjoyed the experience . the cinema ' s are fabulous and surrounded by many eateries . there are several food halls throughout this mall so , you will be spoiled for choice in deciding where to eat however , be aware that this is aligned to the high end status of the mall so , no cheap eats ! best to catch a taxi because parking is expensive and horrendous and so much easier being stuck in traffic with a taxi than driving your own vehicle . .

  " locationnext to kempinski hotel , the grand indonesia mall is centrally located opposite a symphony light show fountain in busy jakarta . we stayed at “ all seasons jakarta thamrin ” ( see my review ) $T$ and walked about 10 minutes to reach the mall . we entered through an office building from one section going up the elevators and walking through a book shop . after visiting a currency exchange , we browsed around then headed to the basement for lunch at “ caf é betawi ” ( see my review ) and a sponge dessert cake at “ momoiro ” ( see my review ) . toursit vouchers ( see attached photo ) there are tourist vouchers for overseas visitors at one of the information desks . the mall consists of popular brands , food section , supermarket and garment retail . compared to the glitzy , glamourous malls of bangkok ( see siam paragon , central embassy review ) , the indonesia grand mall is not as sophisticated , elegant or stylish . the traffic congestion on weekends is notorious , but thankfully we did not have to worry and walked back to all seasons with a full tummy . summarygood location ! .

  " grand indonesia mall is a huge mall offering a variety of different designer stores , has two great food courts , and a couple of decent supermarkets . the usual brands such as guess , h & m , pull & bear , and others are available with prices comparable to other asean nations . $T$ food options are great and varied for all tastes . the food court on the upper floors has the most variety and lots of fast food options like the halal guys , wendy ’ s , and kfc in addition to lots of local favorites . if it gets too busy , head down to the bottom floor of the west mall side where there is a smaller food court with some good options as well . a cgv movie theater is on the top floor and there is a very nice indonesian gallery exhibit for free in the same area that is worth a visit . overall , grand indonesia is a great mall that , while not comparable to bangkok ’ s siam paragon or centralworld , is worth your time . .

i do not quite get why this is rated so highly . to me it seems to be a standard large mall similar to many others in asia . has some decent shops and eateries but nothing that particularly wows you . good place to get away from the heat . $T$ traffic in the surrounding area is a nightmare . .

" its very convenient to reach this premise , as location exactly at city center . but when make any appointment to meet up , you have to spare the time at least 15 - 30 mins earlier as the $T$ traffic jammed at most of the time . divided into two wings , west area is a good place to find foods and saloon while the east area more to bookstore , gadgets , electronics and gym . .

" located very centrally in jakarta , this mall is very easy to reach by public transportation . if you are a shopaholic or just someone looking for a nice place to have a meal or hangout , this mall cannot get any better . whatever you need , they probably sell it here . great selection of restaurants and cafes , shops , book stores , electronics store . the mall is elegantly designed , unlike your cookie cutter mall . for foreign visitors looking for authentic indonesian handicrafts / souvenirs , they have a special store dedicated to it , right on the upper floor of seibu dept . store . if you do not fancy haggling with the traditional vendors at markets , well you can easily get it here . just know that they charge a premium for the goods they sell there . all in all this is a good $T$ place to visit , not just for shopping but recreation for locals and visitors from out of town / country . .

one of the biggest malls in jakarta and one of the most popular ones too . there are 2 parts to it connected by a walkway . this mall has everything you want . shopping eating and easy taxis . i walked to this mall when i stayed at the oriental mandarine years ago but now i just hop in a blue bird taxi . there is a big muji store on the top floor which is great for household and office things . the $T$ prices are not displayed for everything though so you will have to keep asking . .

" firstly , it is not my preferred mall in town to be in , unless i have a destination of shop / food that i am particularly seeking . some of the shops here are worth the visit , eg . the h & m and uniqlo is one of the biggest sizes outlets in town , there is also central dept store . and some restaurants here are good too , like social house for brunch , benedict , abura soba , and many others . the only downside to this mall is the giant scale and confusing $T$ layout and access which makes it so hard to navigate around . heaps number of people on weekends it can be really suffocating . terrible parking layout and access . also note that its always jammed to get in and out during weekends . my biggest tip is to get there by cab or uber . even having a driver for your own car is exhausting to wait its pickup because of the traffic in / out of the mall . .

i do not now perhaps the place and the design makes it attractive to come here . it is a huge mall . be prepared to walk from shop to shop as it offers great items and you will be lured to buy as the people who come by here are unlikely to go window shopping and leaving the mall without having to buy is a disappointment . there are discounts everywhere . be careful with personal belongings since the $T$ crowd is huge especially during weekend . there is benches for those who need to take a break after walking from shop to shop ( like me ) . and cafes are just steps away at every corner if you need to take a break with coffee and cookies . .

" this was my visit for many times to grand indonesia , i personally do not like it as it was too big and going from east mall to west mall would be such misery haha . . last time i had to go from skye to blitz , i think it took 15minutes and with speedy walk : ) but you can find anything in here start from fashion , food , coffee shop , cafe , cinema , they have it all . but the biggest issue is smoking ! i do not know why this mall still not prohibited people to smoke inside the cafe , and most of the cafe have smoking area inside the mall ( again it is not outdoor area ) . and the $T$ conditioning always have problem at 5th fl ( if i am not mistaken ) the one just below the blitz . if you want to enjoy the cafe such ad union , peoples cafe , benedict , and much more and you bring kids , it is not recommended . .

" recently visited with friends and i must say even with the nearby much older and established plaza indonesia nearby , grand indonesia has managed to create something for everyone . the mall itself has two parts namely west and east , both providing differences for consumers . there is a massive ' fun $T$ park ' built at the top level of the mall , with kids able to ride a small train , flying ' ballon ' on a rotating track along with a giant ' baby / toddler ' gym for the little ones . this mall also houses a number of , now well known , establishments such as caffe milano - a great spot for the casual italian la dolce vita lifestyle whether during a cool afternoon or a night with friends . it also houses others , such as the ' infamous ' olivier cafe . you cannot miss paulaner - restaurant that provided its own microbrewed beer and signature german dishes . extra tip : there is a glorious dancing fountain attraction set up ( ala bellagio las vegas ) near excelso cafe and near the ' new york city ' setting , complete with faux rockefeller / art deco decor . kids and ( i suspect ) adults alike are mesmerized when watching this . .

this shopping mall has everything you need . from groceries to branded goods . the mall is divided into west mall and east mall which targeted the different market . the $T$ interior of the mall is very artistic and interesting . i like their timing system for parking . you get the ticket once you reach the floor you r parking you are car and pay at the same floor too so it saves me some money for parking . the only thing that stained this mall is they are not strict to their tenants regarding indoor smoking regulation . at certain floors you can smell a very strong cigarette smell . mostly coming from the restaurants which belong to ismaya group . aweful ! .

" right up there amongst the top five malls in this city of malls ( over 200 in jakarta at the last count and rising ) . grand indonesia is located near to hotel indonesia roundabout ( rear of kempinski hotel ) and is linked by overhead bridge to yet another mall , plaza indonesia . all the usual brands are on display ranging from the most expensive on the ground floor to the less expensive but still good quality brands as you rise up the building by lift or escalator . and of course we have the mandatory food stalls in the basement floors catering for those tired shoppers wanting a quick bite to eat and a coffee . access is either a 100m walk from the buses that run along jl . sudirman or else take a taxi direct to the main entrance . car access is a possibility but i do not know about the limitations on parking . a good way to spend a few hours and escape the $T$ heat or downpour depending on the season . not my favorite mall as i find it a little confusing as the shops are not very well laid out and before you know it you have walked into plaza indonesia by mistake . which may not be a bad thing to do for a sunday morning stroll . .

well a good time to spend a lot of $T$ time but you might be wise to take a public transport there instead of getting in a car . apparently it took us 20 minute to walk from shangri - la but over 50 minutes in car ! you can find a lot of malls there for your shopping but do visit the national art gallery on the top floor beside the cinema and a handicraft shop . .

" grand indonesia is a huge mall and a landmark in its own right . it is so large that it is divided into two wings . the entrance and lower levels of grand indonesia are not especially impressive . standard jakarta shiny mall with a range of mainstream shops . the basement level contains various low quality eateries . it gets much better a few levels up . the mall looks to be inspired a bit by the more interesting parts of american mall design . various stone - effect walls and more natural lighting look great . as does interesting $T$ signage and slightly quirky pathing . there are a lot of restaurants and those cater to a huge range of potential interests . at the top is a quality blitzmegaplex cinema with a velvet class , 4d , and a sweetbox . the view from the cinema level through the huge glass windows is an impressive jakarta cityscape . malls are not especially interesting places . grand indonesia stands out . .

" conveniently located , it is a very grand mall in the middle of jakarta . there are east and west sections of the mall - i had a chance to walk through a few floors including the food court on the upper floor and through seibu , the anchor department store . the recommended store is the store above seibu which has local handicraft , fabric , bags , accessories , and jewelry . outrageous price tags , but you can take a look to see what is available in this country . the food court / restaurant area on the top floor has many types of food . if you are looking for casual dining , it is a good place to go . the menus are in english and the $T$ staff speak english . .

" the central bank predecessor , namely de javasche bank ( djb ) that had been incorporated in 1828 or 177 years ago . meanwhile , the central bank building in the downtown area that had been constructed and occupied by djb . i am glad that the government to make this as the museum bank indonesia to support the development of the old city zone as the tourism destination at the special territory of jakarta , it would be appropriate decision to designate the central bank building of the downtown area as cultural site preservation by the government and turned into the indonesian central bank museum . the museum has many $T$ exhibits mixed modern and old formats , showing the history of bank indonesia , fascinating ! .

" i am a veteran of many money and banking museums world wide , so finding this was the number one $T$ attraction in jakarta was exciting ( even if you do find that strange . . ) . sadly it was a huge disappointment . sure there are lots of display items and dioramas . there is lots of flashing lights , flat screens and random videos , but there is little cohesive story ( the storyboards jump from 1880 to the japanese occupation in the 1940 ' s . . . ) . all flash and little substance - it fails to track the history of banking and money in indonesia , which would seem to be a basic of this type of museum , historic items - like the old offices give annoyingly little detail of the age , the date of the equipment and furniture or when and why it was used . since june 2015 this free museum has applied a charge of 5 , 000 idr . there is also an audio guide , which was not available to us as its only available until 1330 . if the storyboards and videos are anything to go by , you would be wise to save your rupiah for something else . .

" just like another museum in jakarta where it has poor maintenance and no clear concept of what to be displayed nor what the historic value or significant of the exhibit . the plus point is the holographic room where you could try to catch coins and bank notes to open a virtual explanation of the mint or the notes release . the other good point of the museum is the fine $T$ architecture that was well restored , so we could imagine how old batavia looks like .

" i have been to museum bank indonesia for two times now . this place has been the first museum i visited since i graduated from grade 6 : ) lol ( but true ! ) . i have not been impressed with museum since i was a kid , due to the fact that they are mostly no more than a place where they store stuff , dusty . museum bi is very different , i love coming to this place so much , i even took my kids here in one morning and we walked out from the place feeling happy . children get to see the different trade commodities in their form ( peppercorn , herbs , etc ) , they also get to see the uniforms of japanese , dutch , and indonesia soldier during the old days . the old business meeting rooms , they get to check the old bank safe , a very big one ; also collection of money of the world . i would give my applause for the cleanliness of this $T$ place as well . very well maintained . i did not get to check the toilet though because i live in town . this is definitely a place you have to visit if you are in town . i would also recommend this place for older children and taking your overseas friends here if you would introduce jakarta to your guest . .

" this is a surprisingly interesting and well done museum , and its located right next to taman fatahillah , where there are plenty of other great things to do so that you can justify the trip by a full day enjoying old jakarta . the museum is not huge but there is plenty to see . it is both surprising and enlightening how effectively it lays out jakarta ' s tumultuous and cosmopolitan history through its currency . having been in jakarta at the time , i particularly enjoyed the museum ' s presentation of the 1998 economic and social crisis - - the museum basically presents an overall feeling of panic , just like it was then . it also has a nice , dry commentary on the response to the newly independent country ' s liquidity crisis , when the head of the bank issued scissors to let officials cut the currency in half , thus doubling the money supply and making people buy government bonds with half of t . if only the imf had thought of that trick later . nearly as interesting as the $T$ exhibits is the beautifully restored building itself , whose lovely architecture shows where the dutch colonist ' s hearts and souls could be found . .

" really . . . actually most museum in jakarta has great content , but little $T$ curation , save this one . this reminds me of the mint museum in washington dc and perhaps it is because many of the bank indonesia directors spent lots of their time shuttling to that museum during their visits to the capitol . multi media and interactivity is the word and i really hope that someone will expand the collection and offering of this museum one day . .

" this museum has a lot of potential . jakarta and indonesia as a whole have such a rich and extensive history . unfortunately , the layout of the exhibits was not chronological , and some artifacts did not have labels beside them to explain what they were . a few of the data graphs were low - resolution printouts found on the internet , and so they were quite blurry . some of the photographs in a couple of the exhibits were laid out poorly high up , and so it was hard to read the accompanying information while straining your neck to look up . despite its disorganization and poor layout , if you happen to be in fatahillah square , then i would recommend checking it out . it only costs 5000 idr ( $ 0 . 33 usd ) to enter , and all the $T$ staff very extremely friendly and pleasant , greeting you as you went from room to room . i did learn a few new things about jakarta that i did not know before . .

  " a lovely little museum that introduces you to the city ’ s history - from sunda kelapa to jayakarta to batavia and finally jakarta . while popular among indonesians , very few expats seem to go here , which is a pity . we asked if there was an english guide and were delighted to $T$ meet lulu , who took us on a great tour of the entire premises . as a jakarta local , her insights made the experience even more interesting ! there is quite a lot of written information in english , so you can also wander around on your own . yes , the displays need some work and better aircon would help . but if you adjust your expectations and go with an open mind , you will have a good time ! ( also , the ticket is only 5000 rupiyah . ) . "

" the museum has so many activity on the weekend . specially at the front or we can call it the museum ' s plaza . many exhibition from local artist is taking place most every weekend . you can take pictures with them and post it on your social media . do not think that you will be hunger coz there are so many street food around but if you want to rest your feet in a cozy and cool $T$ place while you eat , you can eat at batavia cafe exactly in front of this museum or on the side of the museum , you will find a small garden cafe . .

" this is not so much a museum with exhibits ( although there are a few ) as it is a building where you can wander around and see what it looked like during the dutch colonial era . as other reviewers have noted , it is essentially a collection of old furniture inside a large , airy , but not air conditioned , $T$ building that was used for administrative purposes by the dutch . according to lonely planet there are also ethnographic exhibits . but when i was there earlier this week ( july 2017 ) , that whole section was closed for restoration with no indication of when it will reopen . .

not a place i would gladly visit again . pretty boring $T$ chairs and tables and paintings of dutch captains or whomever . it seems like a collection of shambles in a nice colonial building but it is lacking information and interest . the woman ' s prison in the basement was flooded . they just let this happen ? no need to come here unless you want to be bored out of your mind or are in love with furniture and old interior design . .

" visited here in may 2015 . somewhat confusingly , you cannot buy tickets at the entrance , you need to go to the right of the entrance . i found the descriptions fairly brief . i expected to get a better understanding of indonesian history ( at least from when the dutch arrived ) . however , the information did not seem to be presented in any particular order . so it did not convey a story to me - more like disparate pieces of information that ( for me ) did not come together . i had the bad luck of coming on a weekday at the same time as a school group . the people describing the $T$ exhibits to the children used a speaker system , which was incredibly loud . some pieces of furniture have descriptions ( e . g . what time period they are from ) . however , others do not , which gives the impression some of the furniture has been added at random based on the fact it looks somewhat old . .

" the site offer a good reference on how the colonial government construct their building and you could clearly see the heavy dutch $T$ architecture on the building . unfortunately , the she will of the building is the only thing left to enjoy , since most of its artifact has been heavily vandalized and there were lack of explanation and guide who could explain the historical significance of this place back in the days . word of caution , beware of picpocket .

" i respect and like the style of the $T$ building , and the effort to bring in plenty of relics . however , the english translation under the exhibits seems a little bit odd . other things are fine . . "

" i love this place more when they started not to allow visitors to step on their own shoes but since the $T$ floor is slippery , you have to watch out you are steps . the history is completed but there are lots of unoccupied spaces . let us go here sinve the ticket price is so cheap ( 1 . 3 usd for adult ) .

" this $T$ museum , which is situated in the old gouverneurs - building , tells you the real history about jakarta ( and all its other names ) . the information in the museum is in english and indonesian , and it is possible to get a " " free " " guide ( which you need to give a small tip at the and of the tour ) . many things in the museum , which are from the time the dutch owned batavia ( jakarta ) , have still the dutch inscriptions on it . i think it is a need for every dutch tourist to go to this place to see how jakarta changed during the dutch occupation of 350 years ! .

i like this $T$ museum and the collection . the museum itself has been improved and refurnished a lot since the last i came here . but this museum is really crowded with people trying to take photograph everywhere in the museum . i literally mean everywhere . i am really annoyed because they take selfies too close to the object that they blocked the view . i really hope this museum add more guard and some photograph restriction so people who want to really enjoy this museum will not be disappointed .

" this museum stands so beautifully with its colonial $T$ style , compares to modern buildings we always see in jakarta . but it seems rather empty . there a lot of blank space in some rooms . just hanging photographs , put some ancient ceramics . but the most unforgettable is the prison where dutch colonials have tortured indonesia people . it is so dark , and narrow . makes me angry to the cruelty of colonials . .

" located in kota tua , jakarta , fatahillah museum is one of the famous historical museums in jakarta . first impression , good . the $T$ place is in good condition , air - conditioned . there are so many historical things such as colonial weapons , inscriptions , women ' s prison , old table and bench . how to get there ? bus transjakarta ( busway ) : stop at kota tuataxi : more simpleand do not forget , beware of pickpocket . .

" this museum could be very important in telling about jakarta ' s past , but just as kota tua itself , it does not fulfill this yet . it could be very interesting but the $T$ collection is quite small . lower floor is interesting but upper floor consists mainly of antique furniture . more stories about the past , pictures , paintings and english translation for every item would be a good move . furthermore , the entrance fee was very cheap ( 5 . 000 per adult , student even cheaper ) .

" the governor ' s $T$ palace is an imposing old building in the dominant location on fatahillah square . entry is once again idr5 , 000 per person and is hardly worth the effort . the large rooms are sparsely furnished with period pieces and other exhibits with so little commentary ( even in bahasa ) that one wonders why they bothered . indonesia has an interesting and immensely rich culture and history , with strong links to europe , even marco polo ; and no attempt it made to present or display this . one is better off visiting other attractions that are nearby . the bank of indonesia museum is one recommendation - at the same cost ! .

" this museum is more about the building itself than the $T$ exhibits . there are some colonial era paintings , furniture , and other items , but nothing worth taking a long look at . the building itself is interesting though with the old architecture and layout . easy to picture colonial officials at work in this building . not a lot to see overall , so you can walk thru it in about 30 minutes or less . it is a good idea to read ahead about it , then once you are there the site will hold more meaning . there are tidbits of info not shared such as the el jaguar cannon now outfront which supposedly brings fertility to women who sit on it , the history of what the building was used for , and the horrors which took place in the courtyard behind the museum ( hundreds of chinese massacred an age ago ) . when entering the museum , you are required to remove your shoes and will receive a bag with flip - flops to wear . this is supposed to help protect the wooden flooring . there are stairs and no elevators , thus not suitable for wheelchairs or strollers . .

" the $T$ display in this museum is a little sparse , but i enjoyed seeing the building undergoing restoration . the hardware in this building is quite something from the door hinges to the locks . many of the furniture in here did not have enough descriptions but what it did was very interesting . would be good to have a little more english displays . it was quite shocking to see the women ' s jail cells and to imagine what it was like for them . overall i felt that this museum is still undergoing transformation but the various uses of the building in the past is evident if you take your time and look carefully . .

" outdoor $T$ place , is hot . yeah , you know is hot when you can feel your own sweat on your back right ? : ) ) make sure to wear a comfortable and still fashionable shirt to have a great feeling in here instead of taking a pics with the historic site of jakarta . many foods around this area is not good enough , is just " " yeah , at least i am eating " " feeling . just about $ 1 - $ 2 for a traditional food . most of time in the weekend , you can find many people to visit this area because of some events or just a man show like wearing ghost costume or magic to get money with entertaining people . we can also find another educational place like museum around this area , you can try to visit them . it just take less than $ 1 , really cheap but great sightseeing around the museum ; ) .

nothing much to see . very few historical artifacts . poor narrative for them . too many noisy people . bad $T$ ventilation so it feels really hot and damp . does not do justice for the actual history . .

" it is a shame that besides some tv ads on regional cable tv stations , the $T$ government does not do a lot to promote the old batavia area . this is the old city part of north jakarta . neglected by most tourists visiting indonesia , you will mostly find local elementary school kids visiting the museum . which is a shame . i try to go there every month or so . ok , it can be annoying to be asked for autographs by hundreds of young kids ( it seems to be a class assignment , just like ' in - depth ' interviews as ' what do you like about indonesia ? ' ) . but the building makes up for it . and that for only a 2 . 000 rupiah entrance fee . . "

" for almost a quarter - millennium this was the dutch stadhuis . do not expect a first rate museum . the big draw here is walking around in one of the finest colonial buildings in indonesia . some stunning $T$ furniture has been arranged in the various rooms , and some interesting other artifacts pertaining to the history of the city are scattered here and there : a mural and a portrait of the most famous ( or infamous ) dutch governor , jan pieterzoom coen , a 250 - year - old teak mimbar ( pulpit ) from a local mosque , some ancient stones with pahlavi inscriptions , a model of a portuguese nao , and so on ( see photos ) . but the main draw is the interior of the building itself . a nice addition to a tour around taman fatahillah . should not take more than 30 minutes to ser everything . two tips : taksi drivers may draw a blank if you ask them to take you to the jakarta history museum . tell them fatahillah museum . and be advised in entry you will be handed a bag with a pair of flip flops in it . you need to wear them and carry your own shoes in the bag until you leave . .

" $T$ jakarta , an always bustling , capital of hustling marketplace . millions of people milling around and sometimes you can still feel isolated . however not at fatahillah square where everywhere you look you can find the many attractions ( and ' freaks ' ) that are a part of the make up of one of the largest cities in the world ! come and be amazed and be inspired . you will find it here . one way or another ; ) .
