" that there is not much to see inside the $T$ building is a sort of mute testimony to the kleptocracy that has ruled the archipelago in one form or other for the last few hundred years and still has something of a death grip . on which note , the beheading sword is a must - see . as are the more or less abandoned buildings on the other side of the square in the left corner . you can wander in and take a look at real decaying history . and maybe watch a few film shoots or weddings while you are at it . the watchtower at the far end affords a commanding view the length of the grand canal as far as the java sea ; you can imagine masts and sails heading out laden with spices from the warehouses that are now the nearby museum bahari . take a bajaj there . .

" the old town hall of batavia still stands in front of the square where they used to hang people but now where you can ride antique bicycles rented for 15 - 30 minutes in one go , close to other precious museums like the museum wayang ( shadowpuppet museum ) , the gorgeous museum bank indonesia , and museum bank mandiri . displaying artefacts , furniture , and other items from jakarta ' s past , this $T$ museum takes us in a tour through time to learn about the history of the big durian . stand in front of the windows on the 1st floor and imagine yourself being there hundreds of years ago , watching the busy square below . stop by the museum ' s store to get some souvenir to take home . the negative is not about the museum itself but more of the tourists who oftenly seem not understanding or caring about the museum rules of respecting and not touching the displays . .

" museum macan has a great interior that highlights the cityscapes as well as the collection on display . the museum might be located in a different part of town that is considered " " hip " " or " " arty " " , yet one can easily spend half a day at the museum - exploring the exhibition , joining the $T$ programs or having a cuppa at the cafe . another thing to note is the exhibition narratives that are easy to understand even by visitors who have little to no art background . .

i am so glad that macan hosts the exhibition of $T$ kusama ' s works . i do not have to go overseas to enjoy the exhibition . macan ' s collection is great as well . the only thing that i disagree with was why we cannot take pictures with big camera . i experience and enjoy the exhibition without my cam in my hand . it did make me focus on reading and seeing the art works but the i felt so sad that i could ' t use my big camera . .

  " i thought this museum might be the answer for a different approach to introduce art to the larger indonesian audience . i am not making a comparison to other museums especially art related museums in jakarta , but to sum up people ’ s experience ; macan is merely a hype . it is very well built , well - marketed , well - funded but poorly managed . if success is to bring a wide mass range of audiences to pay a lot of money and willing to queue patiently to take a selfie in front of yayoi kusama ’ s infinity room , instead of introducing the richly diverse of indonesian and $T$ world art and becomes a bridge to educate people , then macan has done its job . .

" the national museum is a referential place for understanding the cultural mosaic of indonesia and its complicated past merging hindu - buddhist traditions , chinese trade , muslim invasions , and the first historical contacts with portuguese in the early 16th century , after that the dutch colonial process that built up batavia . the visitor is surprised at the museum entry with the portuguese " " padrão " " ( a stone column ) with the arms of king manuel ( 1495 - 1521 ) , celebrating the treaty of sunda kelapa . then , when you enter the large $T$ rooms and corridors of the museum , we are astonished by the vast amount of hindu monuments , precious ceramics , woodcrafts , and textiles . it takes hours to construct an organized visual memory of all these thousands of objects . and this is the main problem of the national museum : it still follows old 19th - century repositories of massive collections of all objects about historical cultures . the museum needs to select only some moving artifacts and use them to highlight us on the unique history of java and later indonesia . more virtual information and activities for children and teens are needed . .

not sure if all the $T$ exhibits were original or copies of originals - it was hard to tell . supposedly one of the skulls was a homo floriensis ( the hobbit people ) . good collection of paleolithic to early bronze age materials . nice older colonial building re - purposed for the museum . some bizarre kids - show was going on downstairs . . . . .

" at least it is cheap . and has a wonderful modern $T$ artwork out the front . take note of the opening hours , and perhaps start at the top floor so you can see the gold - they close this section 30 minutes earlier than the rest of the museum . but of course that information is not displayed anywhere . which is really inline with the museum policy of not displaying anything very well at all . totally amateur . i would not recommend it . if you are interested in asian history better you save your money and go to japan or singapore or somewhere that respects the past by honouring it with a plaque - instead of an " " ancient stone with vishnu ' s footprints " " which is actually a hollow fibreglass piece of junk . just like all the " " fossils " " . tap them if you do not believe me . they would be better off melted down and made into an aboveground swimming pool that could sit in the middle of one of the jakarta roundabouts for the kids . hey management ! look into how the indonesian bank museum curated its collection ! ! ! .

" the $T$ museum is very clean and nice . there are so many collections from indonesia ' s prehistoric times until indonesia ' s modern times . the local guide told us the stories about the collections with interesting and easy to understand explanations . i think that the 4th floor is interesting , because there are collections that are made from gold and ceramics , but we are not allowed take pictures or videos at the 4th floor , to avoid replication . .

" i went to both this museum and the history museum which are essentially the same . chronological presentation is no longer enough for visitors to learn anything . there are no ideas as to curation . someone needs to combine and distinguish these two museums . if i had to choose , i would choose this one over the history museum . even though it is twice the $T$ price simply because it is bigger . and slightly more air conditioned . .

i rarely visit the museum because most museums in indonesia are not well managed . but national museum is exception . by $T$ paying only 5 000 ( adults ) & 2 000 ( children ) you can visit all areas within the museum . i think all museums in indonesia should have minimum standards like this so they can attract more people to visit and share good a knowledge for all generations . the museum has an incredible collection and invaluable price . historical objects from prehistoric times until independence can be seen in this place . .

" we visited the museum with our tourguide ; the outside of the museum is nice , there is a stark contrast between the ' old ' museum ( temporary closed when we were there ) and the modern new one right next door . outside there are some interesting sculptures , so the anticipation was high when entering the new building . on the ground floor there is some explanation of the past , with an imaitation cave and statues , the up to the first floor . in general the remark is that most of the pieces do not come to their full value , as either the lighting could be better or the presentation could have been improved . it is a shame , because in itself i think the museum has some quite nice possibilities . especially on the last floor , where you can find the gold treasures , you can see that indonesia has a lot to offer in terms of art and history . our $T$ guide did his best but all in all my impression of this museum was average , and i do not think i will revisit . .

" with so little to do and see in jakarta , the national museum comes near the top of the list of ' to do ' s ' but it would not be worth much of anyone ' s time anywhere else . of the two main buildings , one is closed until july 2018 . the other holds artefacts ranging from the earliest humans on the islands until the 20th century , but they are all rather badly displayed and of little consequence . the fourth floor holds the best exhibits , a treasury of jewellery , gold and porcelain , but this is the one $T$ area where photography is forbidden . probably because it is the only thing worth photographing . it costs ir10 , 000 to enter ( that is about us $ 0 . 75 ) so i guess you get what you pay for . if you are intending to visit the memorial across the street , you will need to take a taxi or tuktuk to get there . they may be physically within spitting distance , but the entrance to the memorial park is the exact opposite side to the museum and it would take at least 1 hour , possibly longer to walk to the entrance . in jarkarta ' s heat , humidity & smog , that would be tricky . .

" the national museum was cool . massive statues , neat art , and historical items adorned the small location , and drummers from indonesia beat out a mean song for the low price of the place . however , it was not exactly well - curated . the section on indonesia ' s history was a little jumbled , and poorly lit . it did not flow from period to period well , and ultimately left me wanting more . the $T$ place is still worth it - it is something to do , and the art is neat and it is cheap - but do not expect something as marvelous as lonely planet leads you to believe . i would spend an hour or two in there - maybe more , if the large closed section reopens soon . 6 / 10 - museum is undergoing renovation and not amazingly put together . .

  " i thought a trip to this museum would be the perfect ending to my two months trip here across indonesia . i thought it would be the national pride with the best “ stuff ” on display but sadly it represents national laziness instead . there must have been $T$ 500 staff but most of them doing absolutely nothing but chatting to one another and puffing away on ciggies . it was supposed to open at 8am but i did not get a ticket until 8 : 30 - no information given nor , ( after seeing my confused expression ) , even care about visitors nor given the reason why . the display cases were filthy with fingerprints and the lights were turned off for roughly half the exhibits . the explanation cards full of dust and so small print you could barely make it out . after covering the first two floors i was ready to see the next - accessible only via elevators but they did not work . when i finally found someone to ask ( none spoke english surprisingly ) , about how to get to the next floor , the guard simply said “ closed ” . that was that . not impressed . .

" okay , i have heard great things about this $T$ museum . in reality it is less than very good but better than just ' good ' , if that makes any sense . . . there is some very interesting stuff in there and it is nice to learn about indonesia ' s history but the written information kind of reads like a primary school history project , so does not really enlighten you in ways that it could . ( i . e . ' humans needed boats for sea travel ' or ' people wore clothes for warmth and for status . . . ' ) but it is definitely worth a visit and it is a nice way to spend a few hours out of the sun . it closes at 4pm , so give yourself enough time to get around . it is big , but not huge , so two hours should be plenty ! .

we had two problems with this museum . one it took us 40 $T$ minutes to drive the 6 kilometers to get there ( terrible traffic ) and two - half of it is closed for renovation . the half we did see was very good . the displays are nicely laid out and there is plenty of information about the history ( and pre - history ) of indonesia if you are interested . i have read that the average visitor spends a couple of hours there . we were in and out in under an hour and we did not hurry . not only was half of it closed but downstairs also . i presume that is where the shop used to be ? ? there is a nice little cafe to use up a bit more time . it took so long to get there that we opted for the bus back . that was an adventure in itself but definitely faster than a taxi . lastly it ; s cheap so we did not mind the disappointment too much . verdict : go when they have finished the refurbishment . it is not worth the journey otherwise . .

" the national museum boasts a wide array of historical $T$ displays and artefacts ranging from before and after independence . it is definitely a great place for visitors who are not exactly familiar with the indonesian background and wish to explore deeper into her rich heritage and culture . the exhibition , which constitues of 2 main buildings , features a variety of archaeologic , prehistoric and modern collections . the old colonial - styled building remains in its architecture and interior whereas the new 4 - levelled building is arranged thematically to present themes such as human environment , science & technology , social organization and lastly foreign ceramics . i personally like the new building more because of the interesting global aspects and artefacts and plus , it is well air - conditioned compared to the older building which only provides air - conditiong in certain areas . i especially enjoyed learning about the various indigenous ethnics and their way of life in the diffferent regions of indonesia . i would suggest devoting a good 3 - 4 hours of your time here to digest as much historical information about the country . however , if you just wish to make a quick stop then i recommend you to go forth to the ethnography section of the old building which comprises a lot about the various indonesian ethnics and their traditions . .

  " the national museum ( museum gajah ) and its collections ( pe textiles , sculptures , tribal art ) is situated in an old colonial - style building near the national monument ( monas ) and the old city ( kota tua ) . the extensive collection gives a good overview of the richness in cultures throughout the ages of the indonesian archipelago . a contribution to this visit was the free guided tour in english , provided by the indonesian heritage society and the museum . the professional trained guide brought the collection alive during a highlights tour . this is a valuable adding to the visit , since many labels are not that elaborate . the new and modern wing of $T$ the museum is escpecially nice with it is old golden treasures on display and the rooms have airconditioning ( old part of the museum not ) overall it is worth a visit ! especially if you are interested in the art & culture of indonesia . entrance fee : 10 . 000 rph ( € 0 , 65 cent ) english guided tour : free .

" very close to monas . needs a careful renovation , at first sight . . . rather like a 1950s style $T$ museum , and i can imagine people being disappointed . however , if you persist with the appearance and sometimes gloomy lighting and read the details , there are lots of interesting displays here , describing some of the cultural history of some parts of indonesia . i found remarkably few exhibits in the main building that did not have an english description , and ended up spending more time than i expected perusing these . despite that , a modern makeover would be a good idea . indeed , at first , i though that the museum consisted mostly of an assortment of rock carvings from temples of various kinds ( which were in fact very poorly described and seemed to be not systematically arranged ) , until i found the rest of the museum ! as a national museum , it needs some attention . .

first i was amazed about the well conserved $T$ building and the calm one can feel inside the museum . then i discover they have a vast collection of ancient objects starting from the early prehistoric times of indonesia . i was also very happy seeing that most of the exhibits have english translations and you are no lost about the information in the panels . it was also surprising to discover that there are a lot of doors hiding more exhibitions behind . go and open all of them and you will not miss any of the halls . .

" indonesia ' s national $T$ museum has a history that began long before indonesia gained its independence - - 1778 in fact . the museum has been expanded numerous times since , most notably the " " gedung gajah , or " " elephant building " " which takes its named from a bronze elephant presented by the king of siam . the collection kicks of with prehistory ; humans have been in indonesia for a very long time . archaeology , history , ethnography and geography all feature . in all , its well worth a visit but it is a trifle dusty . by the way , the museum is near the monas station in the centre of jakarta . . .

" visiting this museum after my 6yo watched ' night at the museum ' movie , he wants to see the real thing . there are various sections , one for statues where interesting scultures mainly of hindu gods , section on ceramics were interesting since some pots are more than 6000 yrs old ! section on various islands of indonesia showcase rich indonesia cultures . love the part about traditional houses , for those interested in architecture / interior design , you will find this section interesting . $T$ fee rp 5000 for adult and rp3000 / child . even my son find the museum entertaining and was not bored at all . if you want to stop to read every exhibit , it can take 2 - 3 hours . it took us around 1 hour to wander around , reading only the pieces that interest us . .

part of the $T$ museum was under renovation and we arrived there an hour before the closing hours . it was a very informative take on the history of jakarta and i love museums so much that i would have enjoyed this if only i had enough time . the only downside from this was the security because there were a bunch of kids who were fooling around the museum displays and the security did not even come to apprehend them about their disrespect to their country ' s treasures . .

" first , one of the buildings is the original beautiful old building built by the dutch to house the museum , and is worth a look in itself . but check , because this one was due for renovation and may be closed . second , the collection is very interesting , especially the old part with its glass and wood exhibition cases . the ceramics were fantastic . upstairs in the new part is a treasure trove that was found in an old shipwreck . third , there are free $T$ tours in different languages , by volunteer guides from the local heritage society . these guides are very well informed and each tour is different so you can go back for another . check the times with the museum . fourth it is easy to get to the museum , the local busway stop is right opposite . also you can cross the road and walk in the shady park as well . .

  " tunjungan plaza is a huge mall in the center of the city of surabaya . the mall is about 6 story tall with well known international brand stores located on different stores . interiors are very clean and shiny . the real anchor store is “ matahari ” that spreads over different floors and is truly huge . matahari has floors devoted to man , woman and children clothing , shoes , cosmetics and accessories . the variety is mindboggling . however , few sales girls speak english and people not knowing bhasa indonesia would face difficulty in communications . all sales persons are however extremely courteous , a thing that i have seen all over indonesia . mall has a large number of restaurants , specially concentrated on the lower ground floor and in the food court on top floor . coffee shops are on all floors . the mall has the facility of valet parking and taxies are easily available . we stayed in the nearby jw marriott hotel that ran an $T$ hourly shuttle to the mall that made it convenient to visit the mall for a coffee or to do shopping . well worth a visit . .

" the fact that a shopping mall is at the top of tripadvisor for best things to do tells you all you need to know about surabaya . there is very little for tourists to do in surabaya . it is indonesia ' s 2nd largest city and indonesia ' s dirtiest city . however , this would be one of indonesia ' s largest shopping malls . surprisingly , they are still building and have plans to make the mall even larger , when the whole mall has a large number of already empty $T$ shops . every floor has several shop fronts boarded up . looks like many retailers cannot make enough to pay the high rents and go out of business . for foreign visitors it will just be a ' shopping mall ' , but if you find yourself in surabaya there is not much else to do here . .

staying in a hotel nearby so visited to see if this has anything different than other plaza ' s that look the same in every city in most countries these days . it is big and spread out . a maze of connections give you access to five shopping centers with up to 7 or maybe more levels . so it might take a while to get around . shops blend after a while as it is the same stuff available in every other shopping plaza you might visit . lots of eating places between plaza 2 and 5 ( i think that is where i was ) . seems more than a safe $T$ place to be . .

" the mall is full of places to eat and very complete . it has chinese food like 369 , western food like a & w ; kfc , japanese food - sushi tei , bentoya . and cinemas . you can find sogo , hero , to buy things . the parking lot for motor bike is really crowded and hard to find a place . the $T$ distance to walk from the parking lot into the building is really far . .

" looks like any world class mall in any developed city . good $T$ food and well priced esp for international travellers . problem is english is not well understood here even though the products on sale are all like products we find in kuala lumpur , singapore , sydney or toronto and we may mistakenly felt like home . fortunately everything is well tagged though ordering food where discounts are given when a certain amount are consumed may be tricky . great place to escape the heat and traffic chaos of surabaya . lots of atm machines too with cinemas , hotels , entertainment for kids , food courts and solid restaurants covering pizzas to peking duck to dim sums to kfc and more . .

" i though it was a big and great $T$ mall . . . well , it is a shopping mall but with nothing that good . it is something normal that you can easily find everywhere you go . i have heard great things about tp but i really did not find anything that special there . just a normal shopping mall . . "

we were lucky to hit the mall during ramadan sales when we really needed to replace travel shoes ! bought adidas f50s for usd35 as well as several pairs of running shoes . several coffee shops are located in every floor as well as a food mall on the 3rd floor . extremely crowded on weekends . food costs about usd 2 - 5 in kiosks and 4 - 10 in big restaurants . $T$ toilets are extremely clean and easy to locate and has about 3 per floor . most stores had garments and wares on sale and did not mind throngs of people pulling from baskets falling on one another . .

" sprawling one - stop shopping complex , boasting international brands ( bally , gap , banana republic , raoul , sogo ) to local brands ( matahari , gramedia , stroberi ) . there are plenty of food outlets ( food courts , chinese restaurants , coffee joints etc ) . for your convenience there are plenty of atms and some pharmacies and salons . excellent $T$ location in the heart of the city . definitely the place to start one ' s shopping spree ! .
