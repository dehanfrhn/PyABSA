although there are some areas that are no longer like the original , but the museum is still very attractive . some of the displays are not accompanied by explanation . there is no guide . the security guard was not seen everywhere . there are some places that should prohibit visitors take photos , but in the absence of security , this rule is not followed properly . there is no regulation regarding a ban on carrying food and drinks . $T$ jakarta regional government should tighten regulations and ensure that regulations are adhered to . in general , this place is still worth visiting . .

i visited the museum because the work of one of my favourite german filmmakers , julian rosefeldt was on exhibit . alongside , famous indonesian performance artist melati suryodarmo ' s work is also on display . for both , the $T$ curation was fantastic , and the experience was definitely sensual . the only negative factor in this museum is the very limited indonesian collection . without the melati exhibit , indonesia would have been utterly underrepresented . .

jakarta lacks world class museums , but the jakarta history $T$ museum is one of its best . located in a colonial - era building overlooking fatahillah square , it traces the development of the city and the colonial influences . displays are well labelled in english and bahasa , and there is a short introductory film on a continuous loop , do not be put off this museum by a negative review in one of the few english language guidebooks - it is certainly worth visiting , is inexpensive and added greatly to my knowledge of indonesia , not just jakarta itself : i preferred it to the national museum , .

beautiful old colonial building , several bits - & - pieces of artefacts , some lovely old $T$ furniture on display . it is worth going into just to see the building & especially to see the dungeons out the back , but things are very poorly displayed , so do not expect too much . tip : they ask you to change out of your shoes & into slippers ( scuffs ) to protect the floors . make sure take your slippers off when you walk down the stairs . i slipped & fell down the stairs because the scuffs are so slippery . did not break anything , but bruised myself badly . you are better off to walk barefoot . .

me & wife came to this mall a few times during our stay in surabaya as our hotel is located 700 meters away . this mall is huge which is devided into a few section tunjungan plaza 1 ( tp1 ) to tunjungan plaza 6 ( tp6 ) . just like any other mall , it has restaurants and retail shops but the $T$ layout was a bit confusing . you might missed some outlets due to the layout and you need to spend at least more than half a day to complete visiting all the outlets . it is a great place to spend your day since surabaya does not have many attractions to visit . .

ghost stories aside , fatahillah museum is basically the best place to catch a glimpse of once glorious voc city built on top of the dark side of colonialism . for enthusiast of old city view , this museum is a must - see and for those interested in history , the old government building offered more than your history textbooks . you can witness beautiful european $T$ architecture contrasted with the grim underwater prison . it is a pity that the government put minimal attention on the well - being of this historical landmark , a common case in indonesian historic ground maintenance . .

for anyone who is used to european museums the expectation is nearly inevitably disappointed . the museum has some nice exhibits but nothing really spectacular . it seems that only few pieces remained from the colonial area and all of them made their way into this museum . so it does not really look like the top picks selected from a big portfolio . better spend your time opposite at the colonial style $T$ cafe . .

the $T$ museum attempts to bring to light jakarta ' s history , but does not have that much to say , and not that many artifacts to show . the most interesting thing about the museum is the building itself , it is architecture , the prisoner holding cells underneath , and the big square in front . here one can rent bikes to explore this historical area - this was the best part of my visit , this part i would rate of 5 / 5 . .

it is a wonderful space for contemporary art to be displayed but : at 100 , 000 idr it is incredibly expensive for locals . the day i was there it was almost 100 % foreign tourists . whilst the chinese artist xu bing exhibition was wonderful where was the indonesian art ? there was i believe only one piece from an indonesian artist on the much smaller gallery $T$ space on the upper level . this generic museum could be in any city in china , europe or the usa . i do not see the value for locals in jakarta . .

not a huge amount of particular interest here in this museum , mainly wall fresco ' s and models of historical events . the building itself is probably more interesting than any of the $T$ exhibits , but sadly , the upstairs gallery was closed on the day i visited . it only costs ir5000 to visit ( about us $ 0 . 35 ) so you get what you pay for with this bargain . nice way to explore the old town square . .

cc ( 18 . 01 . 27 ) this museum was located in fatahillah sqaure , and we visited there for knowing about jakarta ' s history . the $T$ exhibition was not many , but good to see about jakarta ' s history . on trip way , i think it was important to know about destination ' s culture and history . so there was good to us for knowing jakarta ' s history . .

the museum of modern and contemporary art in nusantara was showing art work by $T$ xu bing , a chinese artist . the space was quite large and the exhibits were interesting and curated very well . my favourite was this carpet like piece which was made up of thousands of cigarettes . they also had one mirror room by yayoi kusama which was awesome . if you have a couple of hours to spare in the city , then this place would be interesting . there is also a coffee shop and a gift shop on the same floor . worth a visit ! .

with its limited range of exhibits i would only recommend this $T$ museum to people interested in the history of the town when it was called batavia and under dutch rule . maps show the various stages of development and there is a decent collection of period dutch furniture . one of the bookcases is huge with an amazingly intricate carved headpiece . i read once about a 17th century french visitor to batavia who was bored by all the backgammon he saw being played - sure enough there is a beautifully carved backgammon table on display . i enjoyed my visit to this museum , which helped to bring the past to life for me , but some people will probably race through it in minutes . .

me & wife came to this mall a few times during our stay in surabaya as our hotel is located 700 meters away . this $T$ mall is huge which is devided into a few section tunjungan plaza 1 ( tp1 ) to tunjungan plaza 6 ( tp6 ) . just like any other mall , it has restaurants and retail shops but the layout was a bit confusing . you might missed some outlets due to the layout and you need to spend at least more than half a day to complete visiting all the outlets . it is a great place to spend your day since surabaya does not have many attractions to visit . .

we really liked the museum , but i have agree with some other reviewers that there were not much to see in all $T$ rooms . the different rooms with themes were very nice and helpful to build an idea of the history of jakarta but it did not feel really completed . another really bad thing during our visit was that they had very load music on in some of the rooms , making it unbearable to take in any information . i do not know if it was just modern pop music or some music with a connection to the history but whatever it was , it was terrible . .

there are not many objects on show in this beautiful building . it is mainly a collection of furniture probably salvaged from the dutch when they left . some pieces are interesting but none are exquisite . unfortunately for this traveller who braved the throngs visiting during the festival holiday , the air conditioning was not working nor were the fans . perhaps if the stroll was more leisurely and in breathable air , the rating would have been more positive . on a constructive note , the mural they are painting in the room beyond the entrance foyer looks very promising , and will improve the $T$ atmosphere somewhat . check it out in a few months . .

tunjungan plaza ( tp ) is probably the biggest shopping centre in town . it started from just tp 1 and 2 when i was small , but now it is tp 6 already ! tp is really a one stop shop , where you can find department stores like matahari , sogo , and all the fashion brands . also , a great variety of $T$ choices , from indonesian food , japanese , american , chinese . love the new food court and shops in tp 6 , the look is very modern . if you have not been to tp for a while , it is worth a visit to enjoy the new tp 6 ! .

museum macan is a modern art museum located in jakarta that offers art exhibition for those who enjoys art . the interior of the museum is very aestethic and modern . the museum offers different exhibitons in every 3 to 4 months . i personally enjoy spending time in the museum because it offers many interesting facts and details . every exhibition is different and it never fails to impress me every time i visit this place . the $T$ curators made an interesting choice of instalations and artistic performance to keep up with the modern era and it proves that art is not boring . .

visitors will pay a pittance to enter here , and the miniscule entrance $T$ fee is surprisingly well deserved as there is very little to see here . the most impressive facet of this museum is the building it is housed in . items on display consist primarily of furniture and a few paintings , though the entire entire is poorly maintained . with a sizeable amount of tlc , jakarta history museum could become the world class institution it is name implies . at present , it exemplifies jakarta ' s woefully lacking investment in the tourism sector . .

almost non - existent interpretive information for the sparse collection of $T$ artifacts means the exhibition is a fizzer in terms of learning & interest . however if you are stuck in town for a few days , then the building , and the area it is located in are probably worth a visit . there is not much else to see in town . .

with its limited range of exhibits i would only recommend this museum to people interested in the history of the town when it was called batavia and under dutch rule . maps show the various stages of development and there is a decent collection of period dutch furniture . one of the bookcases is huge with an amazingly intricate carved headpiece . i read once about a 17th century french visitor to batavia who was bored by all the backgammon he saw being played - sure enough there is a beautifully carved backgammon table on display . i enjoyed my visit to this $T$ museum , which helped to bring the past to life for me , but some people will probably race through it in minutes . .

not a place i would gladly visit again . pretty boring $T$ chairs and tables and paintings of dutch captains or whomever . it seems like a collection of shambles in a nice colonial building but it is lacking information and interest . the woman ' s prison in the basement was flooded . they just let this happen ? no need to come here unless you want to be bored out of your mind or are in love with furniture and old interior design . .

museum ' s collection is not that special but it is interesting to imagine how things were being handled back in the day . the $T$ square below is bustling with activity and is quite nice . just watch the people interact and be part of it . you may be asked for a quick interview or a photo and that is all in good fun . so do not be sour and just oblige once or twice . .

the first exhibition of macan - ' art turns , world turns ' - is an interesting walk through recent art history . the exhibits were varied - and included indonesian artists and those from elsewhere . we joined the free guided $T$ tour ( in english ) . it was excellent . the young guide was vey knowledgeable and showed a real passion for the art work she discussed . the downside is the building itself . the acoustics are so bad and the smallest of sounds carries . therefore it was very noisy , even though people were only speaking quietly . so instead of a pleasant hum the noise level was distracting . .
tour

this museum has virtually nothing to see except a few pieces of furniture from the past . the $T$ guides were all at prayer when we arrived , but actually we did not need a guide since each room only contained one or two pieces of furniture with explanations written in english to explain the era . i do not know why it was so empty , but it was almost as if someone took away things he or she liked and left only a few pieces that they did not . definitely not worth spending money to see . .

beautiful old colonial $T$ building , several bits - & - pieces of artefacts , some lovely old furniture on display . it is worth going into just to see the building & especially to see the dungeons out the back , but things are very poorly displayed , so do not expect too much . tip : they ask you to change out of your shoes & into slippers ( scuffs ) to protect the floors . make sure take your slippers off when you walk down the stairs . i slipped & fell down the stairs because the scuffs are so slippery . did not break anything , but bruised myself badly . you are better off to walk barefoot . .

the museum was closed for restoration during my last trip to jakarta and its unclear when the full restoration will be complete as my understanding is that the dutch are helping out with the project . so i hope when its reopened , they have made it into a world class museum about jakarta ' s history . otherwise and i should mention that when i was in jakarta during ramadan a few years ago , i made the mistake of going on a monday ( my last day in indonesia after flying into jakarta and taking a train to jogya ) to see $T$ kota and the museum along with other museums in the area were closed . .

" the governor ' s palace is an imposing old building in the dominant location on fatahillah square . entry is once again idr5 , 000 per person and is hardly worth the effort . the large rooms are sparsely furnished with period pieces and other exhibits with so little commentary ( even in bahasa ) that one wonders why they bothered . indonesia has an interesting and immensely rich $T$ culture and history , with strong links to europe , even marco polo ; and no attempt it made to present or display this . one is better off visiting other attractions that are nearby . the bank of indonesia museum is one recommendation - at the same cost ! .

a large shopping mall with a rather confusing layout and many expensive / exclusive brands represented . to us the most important features were the reasonably $T$ priced supermarket , as well as dozens of different atms together in one specific area , both on the lowest level . the food court on the same level had a rather unimpressive ambience and a very convoluted payment system , but there were also individual food outlets , including some serving western - style food . .

this $T$ museum is unexpectedly great for indonesia . museums in indonesia usually are poorly funded and curated and basically falling apart due to neglect . however , this place is well - curated and managed and it seems to have some financing behind it . plus they currently have a kusama exhibit which is fun and stunning , plus super instagramable . definitely get your tickets ahead of time - you can do so easily online . parking is easy . there is a starbucks at the main entrance and then a 1 / 15 coffee up on the ticketing level . nice gift shop as well . .

i am so glad that macan hosts the exhibition of $T$ kusama ' s works . i do not have to go overseas to enjoy the exhibition . macan ' s collection is great as well . the only thing that i disagree with was why we cannot take pictures with big camera . i experience and enjoy the exhibition without my cam in my hand . it did make me focus on reading and seeing the art works but the i felt so sad that i could ' t use my big camera . .

made up of few connecting malls . house everything you need . must know where to look for it . connected to sheraton and fourpoints hotels . so convenient for hotel guests to get their daily needs . one improvement it should have is to get the directory installed . it may be there but we just could not locate it . moreover the sign near escalators seem not updated . a bit confusing though . $T$ wifi free for the mall members only . .

this museum has a lot of history in it . it is been standing there for centuries and was once functioned as a city hall . the dungeon was used as prison , and some said ( rumour has it ) there was a secrert passageway from the museum to other places in jakarta . although it is a great heritage of indonesia ' s collonial history , it is sadly , poorly maintained . and for a museum , i would say it is lack of $T$ information to be given to visitors . .

it is a very big $T$ mall . i think it links to a few buildings near to it . it has sogo supermarket the main tenant i think . it has also starbucks for your stop by . it has sephora too . and i get to know about matahari supermarket which caters a good and reasonable price . i think it has all the global brand outlets inside the mall . you will end up the whole day in the mall . .

the museum presents on two floors a number of furnitures , weapons and other exhibits of which some are in really bad conditions in a chaotic way . the $T$ building is really nice from inside and out and since the entrance fee is almost for free its worthwhile a walk through . from the second floor you have a nice view on the square . .

this museum is the only of its style in jakarta and attracts friends of modern art , . the staff is ve4y committed and tnevmuseum has regularly very good $T$ exhibitions . inform yourself before you go about the traffic , if it worse it can take you a lot of time and then it is better to skip . .

the $T$ area is like a glimpse into colonial past . there are more than 1 museum to visit , the area is actually very nice if there are not many people because the area can be very crowded . my advice is better go there on weekdays . the fatahilla museum itself can be better . there are not many artifact to display . .

since my very first visit up til now , the museum looks the same . i suggest they have to make changes regarding their management , their $T$ rules , the ticket price , everything and make it very strict . the building contains a lot of indonesian histories but they are neglected and people just do not care , they just want to take photos or simply hang out . it is just , for me , so sad . .

as an indonesian , i really proud for the building and initiative of the city government to make this building as a preserved historical building . however , if we speak about museum , this museum should be able to do better . the collections are very minimal , dusty and not well - preserved . i think the management should arrange more attractive $T$ displays so the visitors can understand better about the collections ( even without hiring a guide ) . i do hope the reconstruction may improve the visitors ' experience . .

the $T$ fatahillah museum is a museum providing an insight into jakarta ' s colonial past . it showcases quite a few objects of regular usage like furniture , weapons and crockery from the colonial and pre - colonial era along with paintings and potraits . a visit to the museum should be accompanied by a tour guide to get complete information otherwise it would be difficult to appreciate it . .

a large shopping mall with a rather confusing layout and many expensive / exclusive brands represented . to us the most important features were the reasonably priced supermarket , as well as dozens of different atms together in one specific area , both on the lowest level . the food court on the same level had a rather unimpressive $T$ ambience and a very convoluted payment system , but there were also individual food outlets , including some serving western - style food . .

this $T$ museum has a lot of history in it . it is been standing there for centuries and was once functioned as a city hall . the dungeon was used as prison , and some said ( rumour has it ) there was a secrert passageway from the museum to other places in jakarta . although it is a great heritage of indonesia ' s collonial history , it is sadly , poorly maintained . and for a museum , i would say it is lack of information to be given to visitors . .

the $T$ museum portrays through artifacts a piece of colonial history of jakarta , with furniture , tools and other artifacts , such as the sword of the executioner of batavia . in my opinion , if you are interested in the history of the most ancient part of jakarta , the museum is a must see . .

the historical buildings need a lot more attentions from the government in particular and the people in general . many beggars and the toilet was smelly and unclean . vandalism decorated the buildings . it would destroy the historic value of the buildings . it is also terribly dirty . the people in indonesia cared nothing about cleanness . recently , i heard one of the $T$ president ' s son bought a historic landmark in menteng area and deliberately deserted it . it has been listed as protected building and the government did nothing to prevent the boy from destroying the house that used to be a very beautiful landmark . .

this museum is unexpectedly great for indonesia . museums in indonesia usually are poorly funded and curated and basically falling apart due to neglect . however , this $T$ place is well - curated and managed and it seems to have some financing behind it . plus they currently have a kusama exhibit which is fun and stunning , plus super instagramable . definitely get your tickets ahead of time - you can do so easily online . parking is easy . there is a starbucks at the main entrance and then a 1 / 15 coffee up on the ticketing level . nice gift shop as well . .
