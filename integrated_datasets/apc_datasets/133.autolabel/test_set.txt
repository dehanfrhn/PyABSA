this museum is located in a dutch colonial government building . the entrance fee is about 0 . 5 euro and that is more than enough , given that the museum does not have much on display but some pieces of furniture from the previous centuries and some prison cells accessible from an inside courtyard ( women ' s cells were flooded ) . little $T$ information provided , esp . for those who do not speak the local language . .

there are many excellent museums in jakarta - unfortunately this is not one of them . it is good to see this impressive colonial building , and as a building per se it serves as being note worthy . as a museum it has some period furnishings , canon balls , canons , and some stones . alleged $T$ elephant footprints in rock are unconvincing , whilst a termite attacked mosque pulpit is an attractive remnant from the colonial era . there is not a great deal to see and absolutely no air conditioning - so prepare to sweat your way around . i love museums , but i will not be going back to this one ! .

this a summary of my overall experience in $T$ jakarta . be aware , you will be required to pay 25 for you visa upon entry of the country and 20 usd upon leaving . this is a nickel and dime country . oh not to mention the toll fees upon entering and leaving certain areas . if you plan to go to java , you will pay a service fee upon entering and leaving appx 5 usd . if you find someone who speaks pretty good english , stick to them because not many outside of my hotel spoke it . .

the site offer a good reference on how the colonial government construct their building and you could clearly see the heavy dutch $T$ architecture on the building . unfortunately , the she will of the building is the only thing left to enjoy , since most of its artifact has been heavily vandalized and there were lack of explanation and guide who could explain the historical significance of this place back in the days . word of caution , beware of picpocket .

there are not many objects on show in this beautiful $T$ building . it is mainly a collection of furniture probably salvaged from the dutch when they left . some pieces are interesting but none are exquisite . unfortunately for this traveller who braved the throngs visiting during the festival holiday , the air conditioning was not working nor were the fans . perhaps if the stroll was more leisurely and in breathable air , the rating would have been more positive . on a constructive note , the mural they are painting in the room beyond the entrance foyer looks very promising , and will improve the atmosphere somewhat . check it out in a few months . .

beautiful old colonial building , several bits - & - pieces of artefacts , some lovely old furniture on display . it is worth going into just to see the building & especially to see the dungeons out the back , but things are very poorly displayed , so do not expect too much . tip : they ask you to change out of your shoes & into slippers ( scuffs ) to protect the $T$ floors . make sure take your slippers off when you walk down the stairs . i slipped & fell down the stairs because the scuffs are so slippery . did not break anything , but bruised myself badly . you are better off to walk barefoot . .

the fatahillah museum is a museum providing an insight into jakarta ' s colonial past . it showcases quite a few objects of regular usage like furniture , weapons and crockery from the colonial and pre - colonial era along with paintings and potraits . a visit to the museum should be accompanied by a tour $T$ guide to get complete information otherwise it would be difficult to appreciate it . .

this $T$ museum was really worth seeing because of the lovely old building ( the old dutch colonial town hall from batavia times ) and the interesting things in it , which are shown in a fairly haphazard manner . there is a cannon in the courtyard which has an unusual shape and story to it ( apparently many locals believe it helps fertility in women ) . check though as it is due to be renovated some time . try to see it before they do this ! .

it is a wonderful $T$ space for contemporary art to be displayed but : at 100 , 000 idr it is incredibly expensive for locals . the day i was there it was almost 100 % foreign tourists . whilst the chinese artist xu bing exhibition was wonderful where was the indonesian art ? there was i believe only one piece from an indonesian artist on the much smaller gallery space on the upper level . this generic museum could be in any city in china , europe or the usa . i do not see the value for locals in jakarta . .

the building has great colonial architecture , but i hope the government has to clean up the $T$ stalls that can ruin the beauty of the facade . .

since my very first visit up til now , the museum looks the same . i suggest they have to make changes regarding their $T$ management , their rules , the ticket price , everything and make it very strict . the building contains a lot of indonesian histories but they are neglected and people just do not care , they just want to take photos or simply hang out . it is just , for me , so sad . .

this is one of my favorite place in jakarta , because i love $T$ art and architecture and yeah history . cultural heritage and good spot to take many pictures . but , why they has a monkey outside the museum ? my boyfriend was attacked by that monkey , i think the monkey must be put aside , i do not mind if there was a monkey at least the monkey does not hurt anyone . .

not a huge amount of particular interest here in this museum , mainly wall fresco ' s and models of historical events . the building itself is probably more interesting than any of the exhibits , but sadly , the upstairs gallery was closed on the day i visited . it only $T$ costs ir5000 to visit ( about us $ 0 . 35 ) so you get what you pay for with this bargain . nice way to explore the old town square . .

the building is the same design as in buildings in colonial era . they only renovate but keeping most of the parts the same . the museum has historical stuffs of jakarta . old coins and money , furnitures from colonial era , but the most fascinating for me is the prison . on that prison , the dutch held some famous historical people , such as , cut nyak dien . you can also see the metal balls that they use to tie the prisoners leg . the entry $T$ fee also very cheap ! and nowadays they have aircon inside . .

$T$ macan stands for museum of modern and art contemporary in nusantara . i agree with other reviewer , indeed finally we do have a proper , international standard museum . they have several interesting program where we could participate as volunteer . kiddo joined their kids workshop and was quite amused . definitely will come here regularly to facilitate kiddo â€™ s interest artwork creativities . hope to inspire him too . two galleries we visited , the main gallery and one floor up ( 6th ) for pop art collection . entrance fee 100k for adult and 80k for kiddo . there is good coffee by 1 / 15 cafe attached to the museum . .

an interesting walk to the history lane . this was the first ever built building of jakarta ( according to some sources ) and was a dutch colonial establishment . a half day trip can be planned easily by combining fatahillah museum , the bank museum ( adjacent ) a breakfast , brunch or $T$ lunch at cafe batavia following a trip to the old harbor . .

massive shopping centre , known as a mall here in indonesia . something here for most , from a supermarket to a hardware store , from high end $T$ retail therapy to local food court food . department stores galore . reflexology ? no problem , they have that too . currently there are 6 sections to this mall , over 5 to 7 floors , all linked together , so put on some comfy shoes and go exploring . .

really nothing much to see , except the huge building and the yard . the ancient things are all the same , only woodcarving which is have no explanation what is that . when i visited here , it was 11 . 00am and there were soooooo many people without aircon in the building , you could imagine how hot the $T$ place is . the people also lay down on the floor like there is not public places , and it was so not good to be seen . but if you make a stop to others museum surrounding , better to make a stop to here too . once in a lifetime . hahaha . . . .

$T$ fatahillah is and old city and located in the old town of jakarta too . i ' ts an ideal when visit an attraction on the weekend late afternoon an enjoy the indonesia province culture . walking start from sunda kelapa harbour and continue to museum maritiem pasar ikan then walk to galangan benteng , kali besar street there is an old dutch bridge call Â°chicken bridgeÂ° , roa malaka , stasium kota and finish at museum fatahillah . after long walk you can enjoy yourself at the cafe batavia . .

nice museum which we could learn a thing or two about batavia before they became shifted to jakarta . there was an old $T$ dungeon underneath the building which is good to explore and see how the captives was held during those years . a good place to kill some time with a / c available .

museum macan is a modern art gallery compared to the traditional museums . there is an emphasis on attracting youth . there was an exhibition by $T$ bing with very interesting interpretations of his work . my favourite was his piece using cigarettes to show what harm it can do to us . it is pricey compared to other museums but if you enjoy art then this is a good place to come . .

if you cannot find something here to buy you are not trying . this shopping centre is enormous located over 8 / 9 levels and has many offshoot arcades . all the big name brands are here with their very own stores , they are all situated together . . . electronics , homewares , jewellery etc etc there is a large $T$ hall too along with several groupings of restaurants . we spent hours walking around this huge complex and i am sure we did not see most of it ! .

i love museums and so looked forward to this visit to the jakarta history museum . but apart from a few pieces of old furniture and some interesting historical paintings the building is almost empty . why not have some rooms fully furnished in various colonial time periods ? a wasted opportunity to create a world class museum . i suggest visitors go the museum in the basement of the national monument and skip the fatahillah square . is there no curator to take pride in this building and this location ? it seems not . the best things about the museum are the human statues outside and the fact that the entrance $T$ fee is very modest . .

the building and stuff itself was very good . its only need more maintenance . many visitors , mostly young local people , they did not respect with everythings inside , from touching and take pictures which you were not allowed to do that . but they seems did not care . sitting on the quite corner , listening $T$ music quiet loud . i think the government need to do some straight rules about dos and donts inside the museum , otherwise everythings will not last longer . .

almost non - existent interpretive information for the sparse collection of artifacts means the $T$ exhibition is a fizzer in terms of learning & interest . however if you are stuck in town for a few days , then the building , and the area it is located in are probably worth a visit . there is not much else to see in town . .

tunjungan plaza ( tp ) is probably the biggest shopping centre in town . it started from just tp 1 and 2 when i was small , but now it is tp 6 already ! tp is really a one stop shop , where you can find department stores like matahari , sogo , and all the fashion brands . also , a great variety of food choices , from indonesian food , japanese , american , chinese . love the new $T$ food court and shops in tp 6 , the look is very modern . if you have not been to tp for a while , it is worth a visit to enjoy the new tp 6 ! .

i did not have much expectations when visiting museums in jakarta , or indonesia in general as normally they are poorly maintained . but then i was very surprised with the quality of the $T$ exhibitions and the facilities in this museum . they offered plenty activities for art enthusiast , public in general and children ( in fact , they have children ' s corner , where your kids can do some arts ) . by having visited several contemporary art museums in other countries , i can safely say that this place will definitely give you great ' artsy ' experience ! .

the museum has lots of historical object talking about the history of batavia or jakarta . the $T$ building is well maintained but i came during tourist time so it was too crowded . however , this place provide knowledge about jakarta and one of the must visit museum when visit jakarta old town . only 5k for the entrance fee for adult : ) be prepare to bring along your camera , hat , and water . because jakarta is too hot and you need to keep hydrate to walk around the areas . .

indonesians should visit this $T$ place more often . i like the fact that aside from the museum , they have people dressed up as mascots and statues that give more entertainment to the visitors . when visiting inside the museum , you are to wear the slippers that they will provide - own footwear is not allowed inside . great place to learn more about jakarta and its history . .

tunjungan plaza or we called it tp is a super huge mall connect with hotel and apartment , located in the heart of surabaya . you can find almost everything here , from branded store , local store and many $T$ culinary options . there is also beauty salon , clinics and off course child playground . the newest tp 6 had many instagrammable corner that suits well for the youngsters or couples . definitely a must visit place in surabaya . .

there was very minimal $T$ displays and there was not much informations about some of the exhibits . there were some impressive furniture but that was about it . the women ' s prison also left quite an impression . we could looked in the prison which was filled with water and that affected me a little . we had to change into the slippers provided by the museum but i found it uncomfortable to walk around with as they were too huge for me . except for the womens ' prison , in my opinion the musuem is quite boring . .

this museum has virtually nothing to see except a few pieces of furniture from the past . the guides were all at prayer when we arrived , but actually we did not need a guide since each $T$ room only contained one or two pieces of furniture with explanations written in english to explain the era . i do not know why it was so empty , but it was almost as if someone took away things he or she liked and left only a few pieces that they did not . definitely not worth spending money to see . .

this museum probably the most iconic museum in old town area . people will automatically connect old town to fatahillah museum . too bad the museum ' s $T$ facilities are pretty far from good . it is hot and dirty . however , i suppose the jakarta ' s government is in the process of upgrading this museum . this museum offers a display of jakarta ' s history from colonial time , to be honest , the display is pretty good . but they really need to work on the facility . oh , they also have this famous underground jail . you should see it if you come to visit this museum . .

this is really a mall of malls . . . 6 in all , from high end brands to local shops . i think it has 6 floors but depending on how you count it could be a few more : ) as its so extensive , it has everything , so using coffee & tea shops as an example , it goes from local , bubble tea shops , thru the ( urgh ) chains like starbucks to some very nice higher end ones serving great coffee at 24k for a very decent $T$ expresso . foodwise is very similar . head to mall 5 & 6 , for higher end brands etc . .

the $T$ building is of historic value . inside it has two dark faded paintings , twenty bookcases , forty chairs and maybe ten explaining text boards which not located in a logical order . advise : admire the building from the square and use your imagination of a bookshelf in an empty white plastered room . you get the picture ? good , use this advice to save money . .

ghost stories aside , $T$ museum is basically the best place to catch a glimpse of once glorious voc city built on top of the dark side of colonialism . for enthusiast of old city view , this museum is a must - see and for those interested in history , the old government building offered more than your history textbooks . you can witness beautiful european architecture contrasted with the grim underwater prison . it is a pity that the government put minimal attention on the well - being of this historical landmark , a common case in indonesian historic ground maintenance . .

i visited the museum because the work of one of my favourite german filmmakers , $T$ rosefeldt was on exhibit . alongside , famous indonesian performance artist melati suryodarmo ' s work is also on display . for both , the curation was fantastic , and the experience was definitely sensual . the only negative factor in this museum is the very limited indonesian collection . without the melati exhibit , indonesia would have been utterly underrepresented . .

this is not so much a museum with exhibits ( although there are a few ) as it is a building where you can wander around and see what it looked like during the dutch colonial era . as other reviewers have noted , it is essentially a collection of old furniture inside a large , airy , but not air conditioned , $T$ building that was used for administrative purposes by the dutch . according to lonely planet there are also ethnographic exhibits . but when i was there earlier this week ( july 2017 ) , that whole section was closed for restoration with no indication of when it will reopen . .
