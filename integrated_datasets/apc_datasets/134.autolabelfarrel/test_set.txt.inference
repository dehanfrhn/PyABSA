with its limited range of exhibits i would only recommend this [B-ASP]museum[E-ASP] museum to people interested in the history of the town when it was called batavia and under dutch rule . maps show the various stages of development and there is a decent collection of period dutch furniture . one of the bookcases is huge with an amazingly intricate carved headpiece . i read once about a 17th century french visitor to batavia who was bored by all the backgammon he saw being played - sure enough there is a beautifully carved backgammon table on display . i enjoyed my visit to this museum , which helped to bring the past to life for me , but some people will probably race through it in minutes . . $LABEL$ Positive
the [B-ASP]museum[E-ASP] museum portrays through artifacts a piece of colonial history of jakarta , with furniture , tools and other artifacts , such as the sword of the executioner of batavia . in my opinion , if you are interested in the history of the most ancient part of jakarta , the museum is a must see . . $LABEL$ Positive

made up of few connecting malls . house everything you need . must know where to look for it . connected to sheraton and fourpoints hotels . so convenient for hotel guests to get their daily needs . one improvement it should have is to get the directory installed . it may be there but we just could not locate it . moreover the sign near escalators seem not updated . a bit confusing though . [B-ASP]wifi[E-ASP] wifi free for the mall members only . . $LABEL$ Positive
there was very minimal displays and there was not much informations about some of the exhibits . there were some impressive furniture but that was about it . the women ' s prison also left quite an impression . we could looked in the prison which was filled with water and that affected me a little . we had to change into the slippers provided by the museum but i found it uncomfortable to walk around with as they were too huge for me . except for the womens ' prison , in my opinion the [B-ASP]musuem[E-ASP] musuem is quite boring . . $LABEL$ Negative

almost non - existent interpretive information for the sparse collection of artifacts means the [B-ASP]exhibition[E-ASP] exhibition is a fizzer in terms of learning & interest . however if you are stuck in town for a few days , then the building , and the area it is located in are probably worth a visit . there is not much else to see in town . . $LABEL$ Negative
i would say i was expecting to find more hystorical value of jakarta when i stepped into this place . yes . . . i found some interesting showcases but not as much i expected .

the building has great colonial architecture , but i hope the government has to clean up the [B-ASP]stalls[E-ASP] stalls that can ruin the beauty of the facade . . $LABEL$ Negative
there are not many objects on show in this beautiful building . it is mainly a collection of furniture probably salvaged from the dutch when they left . some pieces are interesting but none are exquisite . unfortunately for this traveller who braved the throngs visiting during the festival holiday , the air conditioning was not working nor were the fans . perhaps if the stroll was more leisurely and in breathable air , the rating would have been more positive . on a constructive note , the mural they are painting in the room beyond the entrance foyer looks very promising , and will improve the [B-ASP]atmosphere[E-ASP] atmosphere somewhat . check it out in a few months . . $LABEL$ Positive

the site offer a good reference on how the colonial government construct their building and you could clearly see the heavy dutch [B-ASP]architecture[E-ASP] architecture on the building . unfortunately , the she will of the building is the only thing left to enjoy , since most of its artifact has been heavily vandalized and there were lack of explanation and guide who could explain the historical significance of this place back in the days . word of caution , beware of picpocket . $LABEL$ Negative
this museum was really worth seeing because of the lovely old [B-ASP]building[E-ASP] building ( the old dutch colonial town hall from batavia times ) and the interesting things in it , which are shown in a fairly haphazard manner . there is a cannon in the courtyard which has an unusual shape and story to it ( apparently many locals believe it helps fertility in women ) . check though as it is due to be renovated some time . try to see it before they do this ! . $LABEL$ Positive

a large shopping mall with a rather confusing layout and many expensive / exclusive brands represented . to us the most important features were the reasonably priced supermarket , as well as dozens of different atms together in one specific area , both on the lowest level . the food court on the same level had a rather unimpressive [B-ASP]ambience[E-ASP] ambience and a very convoluted payment system , but there were also individual food outlets , including some serving western - style food . . $LABEL$ Negative
as an indonesian , i really proud for the building and initiative of the city government to make this building as a preserved historical building . however , if we speak about museum , this museum should be able to do better . the collections are very minimal , dusty and not well - preserved . i think the [B-ASP]management[E-ASP] management should arrange more attractive displays so the visitors can understand better about the collections ( even without hiring a guide ) . i do hope the reconstruction may improve the visitors ' experience . . $LABEL$ Negative
really nothing much to see , except the huge building and the yard . the ancient things are all the same , only woodcarving which is have no explanation what is that . when i visited here , it was 11 . 00am and there were soooooo many people without aircon in the building , you could imagine how hot the [B-ASP]place[E-ASP] place is . the people also lay down on the floor like there is not public places , and it was so not good to be seen . but if you make a stop to others museum surrounding , better to make a stop to here too . once in a lifetime . hahaha . . . . $LABEL$ Negative

i feel pretty sad to see this museum . it is dusty and has limited collection , mostly colonial era furniture . instead of enjoying its collection , the thing that i enjoyed was the building itself . the museum is surrounded by several colonial buildings , and some of them are in very bad shape . entrance [B-ASP]fee[E-ASP] fee is rp5 , 000 ( us $ 0 . 5 ) per person . you better go to the cafe batavia right in the opposite direction of the museum . . $LABEL$ Negative
the entry fee of 5000 is definitely worth even a quick walk through this old dutch governors office , which has many similarities with the dutch palace paleis op de dam . while i was there , the second floor was closed unfortunately . inside on the right you find a small exhibition on the history of java . on the other side you find a exhibition of the colony history . it is nothing big and it is not always translated ( correctly ) but you get a good impression and there are friendly [B-ASP]guides[E-ASP] guides . . $LABEL$ Positive
