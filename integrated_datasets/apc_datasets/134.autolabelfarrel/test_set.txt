i visited on a sunday when it was full of kids taking each others ' photos next to amazing pieces of old dutch furniture in the dark interior of the old staadhuis ( city hall ) . i liked the $T$ place although information was a bit sparse . it makes a refreshing change from the interactive / entertainment focus of a lot of museums in the west , and i enjoyed the irreverence ( but totally non - hostile ) of the kids . the museum is on fatahilah square which was full of entertainers , puppet shows , living statues and the youngsters of jakarta having a great time . .

the entrance fee was usd . 35 cents . that should set the stage a bit . you wander through the building looking at old outdated displays . the presentation of the history is jumbled and not very well done . we had a good $T$ time and do not regret our investment , just do not expect much . .

there are not many objects on show in this beautiful building . it is mainly a collection of furniture probably salvaged from the dutch when they left . some pieces are interesting but none are exquisite . unfortunately for this traveller who braved the throngs visiting during the festival holiday , the $T$ conditioning was not working nor were the fans . perhaps if the stroll was more leisurely and in breathable air , the rating would have been more positive . on a constructive note , the mural they are painting in the room beyond the entrance foyer looks very promising , and will improve the atmosphere somewhat . check it out in a few months . .

with its limited range of exhibits i would only recommend this $T$ museum to people interested in the history of the town when it was called batavia and under dutch rule . maps show the various stages of development and there is a decent collection of period dutch furniture . one of the bookcases is huge with an amazingly intricate carved headpiece . i read once about a 17th century french visitor to batavia who was bored by all the backgammon he saw being played - sure enough there is a beautifully carved backgammon table on display . i enjoyed my visit to this museum , which helped to bring the past to life for me , but some people will probably race through it in minutes . .

almost non - existent interpretive information for the sparse collection of artifacts means the $T$ exhibition is a fizzer in terms of learning & interest . however if you are stuck in town for a few days , then the building , and the area it is located in are probably worth a visit . there is not much else to see in town . .

i would say i was expecting to find more hystorical value of jakarta when i stepped into this place . yes . . . i found some interesting showcases but not as much i expected . $T$ explanation on the showcases was not so informative , aircond was not enough to cool down the room , lightning was not so well . i would say it is not very pleasant . it could have been better . .

last time i went there was like a decade ago . back then only 4 $T$ tp , it was inconvenience enough . and now they had to add another 2 . which was not even better . it may have lots and lots of high ends tenants , but the arrangement was all over the places . lack of directory and the information service was unfriendly . such a shame . .

there are not many objects on show in this beautiful building . it is mainly a collection of furniture probably salvaged from the dutch when they left . some pieces are interesting but none are exquisite . unfortunately for this traveller who braved the throngs visiting during the festival holiday , the air conditioning was not working nor were the fans . perhaps if the stroll was more leisurely and in breathable air , the rating would have been more positive . on a constructive note , the mural they are painting in the room beyond the entrance foyer looks very promising , and will improve the $T$ atmosphere somewhat . check it out in a few months . .

the site offer a good reference on how the colonial government construct their building and you could clearly see the heavy dutch $T$ architecture on the building . unfortunately , the she will of the building is the only thing left to enjoy , since most of its artifact has been heavily vandalized and there were lack of explanation and guide who could explain the historical significance of this place back in the days . word of caution , beware of picpocket .

this museum was really worth seeing because of the lovely old $T$ building ( the old dutch colonial town hall from batavia times ) and the interesting things in it , which are shown in a fairly haphazard manner . there is a cannon in the courtyard which has an unusual shape and story to it ( apparently many locals believe it helps fertility in women ) . check though as it is due to be renovated some time . try to see it before they do this ! .

it is a very big $T$ mall . i think it links to a few buildings near to it . it has sogo supermarket the main tenant i think . it has also starbucks for your stop by . it has sephora too . and i get to know about matahari supermarket which caters a good and reasonable price . i think it has all the global brand outlets inside the mall . you will end up the whole day in the mall . .

a large shopping mall with a rather confusing layout and many expensive / exclusive brands represented . to us the most important features were the reasonably priced supermarket , as well as dozens of different atms together in one specific area , both on the lowest level . the food court on the same level had a rather unimpressive $T$ ambience and a very convoluted payment system , but there were also individual food outlets , including some serving western - style food . .

as an indonesian , i really proud for the building and initiative of the city government to make this building as a preserved historical building . however , if we speak about museum , this museum should be able to do better . the collections are very minimal , dusty and not well - preserved . i think the $T$ management should arrange more attractive displays so the visitors can understand better about the collections ( even without hiring a guide ) . i do hope the reconstruction may improve the visitors ' experience . .

really nothing much to see , except the huge building and the yard . the ancient things are all the same , only woodcarving which is have no explanation what is that . when i visited here , it was 11 . 00am and there were soooooo many people without aircon in the building , you could imagine how hot the $T$ place is . the people also lay down on the floor like there is not public places , and it was so not good to be seen . but if you make a stop to others museum surrounding , better to make a stop to here too . once in a lifetime . hahaha . . . .

i feel pretty sad to see this museum . it is dusty and has limited collection , mostly colonial era furniture . instead of enjoying its collection , the thing that i enjoyed was the building itself . the museum is surrounded by several colonial buildings , and some of them are in very bad shape . entrance $T$ fee is rp5 , 000 ( us $ 0 . 5 ) per person . you better go to the cafe batavia right in the opposite direction of the museum . .
fee
Negative
the entry fee of 5000 is definitely worth even a quick walk through this old dutch governors office , which has many similarities with the dutch palace paleis op de dam . while i was there , the second floor was closed unfortunately . inside on the right you find a small exhibition on the history of java . on the other side you find a exhibition of the colony history . it is nothing big and it is not always translated ( correctly ) but you get a good impression and there are friendly $T$ guides . .

$T$ tunjungan plaza is a big mall with no concept . cross from tp1 to tp2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 will cause dizziness and not comfortable experience . lighting is not good , quite dark and crowded with a lot off tenant . for me , this mall is not comfortable to hang out and spend time but may good for shopping only .

the first exhibition of macan - ' art turns , world turns ' - is an interesting walk through recent art history . the exhibits were varied - and included indonesian artists and those from elsewhere . we joined the free guided $T$ tour ( in english ) . it was excellent . the young guide was vey knowledgeable and showed a real passion for the art work she discussed . the downside is the building itself . the acoustics are so bad and the smallest of sounds carries . therefore it was very noisy , even though people were only speaking quietly . so instead of a pleasant hum the noise level was distracting . .

i was here with my mom to see yayoi kusama ' s exhibition . i have seen the one in singapore but took mom to see it here . i would recommend this place since jakarta lacks of attraction and this is good . however , during yayoi ' s exhibition i was not expected to see such long queues , which is also good it means people are coming to this place . but i find how they manage things are not really on point and annoying i must say . but other than those small hiccups it is an interesting $T$ place to visit .

the $T$ museum was closed for restoration during my last trip to jakarta and its unclear when the full restoration will be complete as my understanding is that the dutch are helping out with the project . so i hope when its reopened , they have made it into a world class museum about jakarta ' s history . otherwise and i should mention that when i was in jakarta during ramadan a few years ago , i made the mistake of going on a monday ( my last day in indonesia after flying into jakarta and taking a train to jogya ) to see kota and the museum along with other museums in the area were closed . .
