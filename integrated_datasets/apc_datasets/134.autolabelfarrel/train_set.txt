$T$ museum macan is a modern art museum located in jakarta that offers art exhibition for those who enjoys art . the interior of the museum is very aestethic and modern . the museum offers different exhibitons in every 3 to 4 months . i personally enjoy spending time in the museum because it offers many interesting facts and details . every exhibition is different and it never fails to impress me every time i visit this place . the curators made an interesting choice of instalations and artistic performance to keep up with the modern era and it proves that art is not boring . .

this museum is located in a dutch colonial government building . the entrance fee is about 0 . 5 euro and that is more than enough , given that the museum does not have much on display but some pieces of furniture from the previous centuries and some prison cells accessible from an inside courtyard ( women ' s cells were flooded ) . little $T$ information provided , esp . for those who do not speak the local language . .

there was very minimal $T$ displays and there was not much informations about some of the exhibits . there were some impressive furniture but that was about it . the women ' s prison also left quite an impression . we could looked in the prison which was filled with water and that affected me a little . we had to change into the slippers provided by the museum but i found it uncomfortable to walk around with as they were too huge for me . except for the womens ' prison , in my opinion the musuem is quite boring . .

national museum of indonesia was unfortunately closed on sunday , so i went to jakarta history museum . i really expected that i will acquire broader picture of jakarta , but the museum is not rich in historical $T$ artifacts , there is no explanations of development and growth of jakarta , you can not see history of jakarta in full . .

its a 18th century building , now converted to a city museum , boast artifacts and furniture from across indonesia belonging to the kings & dutch era . . part of the building used to serve as prison during dutch rule , some of the prison cells have stocked up the huge metal balls , which were used to be tied to the prisoners feet to restricted their moment and probably to not let them escape . the women ' s $T$ prison was much nicer though : ) this might be one of the few places to visit in jakarta apart from malls , so you like indonesia or a history buff go visit . . .

this is one of my favorite place in jakarta , because i love art and architecture and yeah history . cultural heritage and good spot to take many pictures . but , why they has a $T$ monkey outside the museum ? my boyfriend was attacked by that monkey , i think the monkey must be put aside , i do not mind if there was a monkey at least the monkey does not hurt anyone . .

it was a great exhibition . they also gave enough information and knowledge . however , there are some attractions that was ( i know ) the popular picture - taking spots , that was given limited time to enjoy or take pictures with . this is a museum , and anyone are supposed to have the right to enjoy the arts as long as they want . and because of that , it is true that this is no longer considered as a museum but a commerce . this exhibition is also lacking of some interactive activities . a bit disappointed by the not - so - nice $T$ staff , especially the lady at the dots room attraction on the upper floor ( forgot the name ) . .

the $T$ building is the same design as in buildings in colonial era . they only renovate but keeping most of the parts the same . the museum has historical stuffs of jakarta . old coins and money , furnitures from colonial era , but the most fascinating for me is the prison . on that prison , the dutch held some famous historical people , such as , cut nyak dien . you can also see the metal balls that they use to tie the prisoners leg . the entry fee also very cheap ! and nowadays they have aircon inside . .

almost non - existent interpretive information for the sparse collection of $T$ artifacts means the exhibition is a fizzer in terms of learning & interest . however if you are stuck in town for a few days , then the building , and the area it is located in are probably worth a visit . there is not much else to see in town . .

me & wife came to this mall a few times during our stay in surabaya as our hotel is located 700 meters away . this $T$ mall is huge which is devided into a few section tunjungan plaza 1 ( tp1 ) to tunjungan plaza 6 ( tp6 ) . just like any other mall , it has restaurants and retail shops but the layout was a bit confusing . you might missed some outlets due to the layout and you need to spend at least more than half a day to complete visiting all the outlets . it is a great place to spend your day since surabaya does not have many attractions to visit . .

for anyone who is used to european museums the expectation is nearly inevitably disappointed . the museum has some nice $T$ exhibits but nothing really spectacular . it seems that only few pieces remained from the colonial area and all of them made their way into this museum . so it does not really look like the top picks selected from a big portfolio . better spend your time opposite at the colonial style cafe . .

as this museum seems to be under two names ( 1 ) as above & ( 2 ) sejarah - it is somewhat confusing . however having a private $T$ guide did make things easier to understand . housed in a former dutch colonial building , beautiful floors ( shoes to be taken off - slippers provided ) and lots of artifacts and ( extremly ) large dutch furniture . well worth a visit to this area to see something of the centre of dutch colonial rule / empire with some fine buildings including this museum . enjoy .

this museum could be very important in telling about jakarta ' s past , but just as kota tua itself , it does not fulfill this yet . it could be very interesting but the collection is quite small . lower floor is interesting but upper floor consists mainly of antique furniture . more stories about the past , pictures , paintings and english translation for every item would be a good move . furthermore , the entrance $T$ fee was very cheap ( 5 . 000 per adult , student even cheaper ) .

this is not so much a museum with exhibits ( although there are a few ) as it is a building where you can wander around and see what it looked like during the dutch colonial era . as other reviewers have noted , it is essentially a collection of old furniture inside a large , airy , but not air conditioned , $T$ building that was used for administrative purposes by the dutch . according to lonely planet there are also ethnographic exhibits . but when i was there earlier this week ( july 2017 ) , that whole section was closed for restoration with no indication of when it will reopen . .

i love museums and so looked forward to this visit to the jakarta history museum . but apart from a few pieces of old furniture and some interesting historical paintings the $T$ building is almost empty . why not have some rooms fully furnished in various colonial time periods ? a wasted opportunity to create a world class museum . i suggest visitors go the museum in the basement of the national monument and skip the fatahillah square . is there no curator to take pride in this building and this location ? it seems not . the best things about the museum are the human statues outside and the fact that the entrance fee is very modest . .

there are many excellent museums in jakarta - unfortunately this is not one of them . it is good to see this impressive colonial building , and as a building per se it serves as being note worthy . as a museum it has some period furnishings , canon balls , canons , and some stones . alleged elephant footprints in rock are unconvincing , whilst a termite attacked mosque pulpit is an attractive remnant from the colonial era . there is not a great deal to see and absolutely no $T$ air conditioning - so prepare to sweat your way around . i love museums , but i will not be going back to this one ! .

" museum macan has a great $T$ interior that highlights the cityscapes as well as the collection on display . the museum might be located in a different part of town that is considered " " hip " " or " " arty " " , yet one can easily spend half a day at the museum - exploring the exhibition , joining the public programs or having a cuppa at the cafe . another thing to note is the exhibition narratives that are easy to understand even by visitors who have little to no art background . .

an interesting walk to the history lane . this was the first ever built building of jakarta ( according to some sources ) and was a dutch colonial establishment . a half day trip can be planned easily by combining fatahillah museum , the bank museum ( adjacent ) a breakfast , brunch or $T$ lunch at cafe batavia following a trip to the old harbor . .

since my very first visit up til now , the museum looks the same . i suggest they have to make changes regarding their management , their $T$ rules , the ticket price , everything and make it very strict . the building contains a lot of indonesian histories but they are neglected and people just do not care , they just want to take photos or simply hang out . it is just , for me , so sad . .

tunjungan plaza ( tp ) is probably the biggest shopping centre in town . it started from just tp 1 and 2 when i was small , but now it is tp 6 already ! tp is really a one stop shop , where you can find department stores like matahari , sogo , and all the fashion brands . also , a great variety of $T$ choices , from indonesian food , japanese , american , chinese . love the new food court and shops in tp 6 , the look is very modern . if you have not been to tp for a while , it is worth a visit to enjoy the new tp 6 ! .

visitors will pay a pittance to enter here , and the miniscule entrance fee is surprisingly well deserved as there is very little to see here . the most impressive facet of this museum is the $T$ building it is housed in . items on display consist primarily of furniture and a few paintings , though the entire entire is poorly maintained . with a sizeable amount of tlc , jakarta history museum could become the world class institution it is name implies . at present , it exemplifies jakarta ' s woefully lacking investment in the tourism sector . .

i was here with my mom to see $T$ yayoi kusama ' s exhibition . i have seen the one in singapore but took mom to see it here . i would recommend this place since jakarta lacks of attraction and this is good . however , during yayoi ' s exhibition i was not expected to see such long queues , which is also good it means people are coming to this place . but i find how they manage things are not really on point and annoying i must say . but other than those small hiccups it is an interesting place to visit .

$T$ macan stands for museum of modern and art contemporary in nusantara . i agree with other reviewer , indeed finally we do have a proper , international standard museum . they have several interesting program where we could participate as volunteer . kiddo joined their kids workshop and was quite amused . definitely will come here regularly to facilitate kiddo ’ s interest artwork creativities . hope to inspire him too . two galleries we visited , the main gallery and one floor up ( 6th ) for pop art collection . entrance fee 100k for adult and 80k for kiddo . there is good coffee by 1 / 15 cafe attached to the museum . .

the first exhibition of macan - ' art turns , world turns ' - is an interesting walk through recent art history . the $T$ exhibits were varied - and included indonesian artists and those from elsewhere . we joined the free guided tour ( in english ) . it was excellent . the young guide was vey knowledgeable and showed a real passion for the art work she discussed . the downside is the building itself . the acoustics are so bad and the smallest of sounds carries . therefore it was very noisy , even though people were only speaking quietly . so instead of a pleasant hum the noise level was distracting . .

this $T$ museum has a lot of history in it . it is been standing there for centuries and was once functioned as a city hall . the dungeon was used as prison , and some said ( rumour has it ) there was a secrert passageway from the museum to other places in jakarta . although it is a great heritage of indonesia ' s collonial history , it is sadly , poorly maintained . and for a museum , i would say it is lack of information to be given to visitors . .

jakarta lacks world class museums , but the jakarta history $T$ museum is one of its best . located in a colonial - era building overlooking fatahillah square , it traces the development of the city and the colonial influences . displays are well labelled in english and bahasa , and there is a short introductory film on a continuous loop , do not be put off this museum by a negative review in one of the few english language guidebooks - it is certainly worth visiting , is inexpensive and added greatly to my knowledge of indonesia , not just jakarta itself : i preferred it to the national museum , .

with its limited range of exhibits i would only recommend this museum to people interested in the history of the town when it was called batavia and under dutch rule . maps show the various stages of development and there is a decent collection of period dutch $T$ furniture . one of the bookcases is huge with an amazingly intricate carved headpiece . i read once about a 17th century french visitor to batavia who was bored by all the backgammon he saw being played - sure enough there is a beautifully carved backgammon table on display . i enjoyed my visit to this museum , which helped to bring the past to life for me , but some people will probably race through it in minutes . .

i was here with my mom to see yayoi kusama ' s exhibition . i have seen the one in singapore but took mom to see it here . i would recommend this place since jakarta lacks of attraction and this is good . however , during yayoi ' s exhibition i was not expected to see such long $T$ queues , which is also good it means people are coming to this place . but i find how they manage things are not really on point and annoying i must say . but other than those small hiccups it is an interesting place to visit .

i love museums and so looked forward to this visit to the jakarta history museum . but apart from a few pieces of old furniture and some interesting historical paintings the building is almost empty . why not have some rooms fully furnished in various colonial time periods ? a wasted opportunity to create a world class museum . i suggest visitors go the museum in the basement of the national monument and skip the fatahillah square . is there no curator to take pride in this building and this location ? it seems not . the best things about the museum are the human statues outside and the fact that the entrance $T$ fee is very modest . .

i did not have much expectations when visiting museums in jakarta , or indonesia in general as normally they are poorly maintained . but then i was very surprised with the quality of the exhibitions and the facilities in this museum . they offered plenty $T$ activities for art enthusiast , public in general and children ( in fact , they have children ' s corner , where your kids can do some arts ) . by having visited several contemporary art museums in other countries , i can safely say that this place will definitely give you great ' artsy ' experience ! .

this a summary of my overall experience in $T$ jakarta . be aware , you will be required to pay 25 for you visa upon entry of the country and 20 usd upon leaving . this is a nickel and dime country . oh not to mention the toll fees upon entering and leaving certain areas . if you plan to go to java , you will pay a service fee upon entering and leaving appx 5 usd . if you find someone who speaks pretty good english , stick to them because not many outside of my hotel spoke it . .

the first exhibition of macan - ' art turns , world turns ' - is an interesting walk through recent art history . the exhibits were varied - and included indonesian artists and those from elsewhere . we joined the free guided tour ( in english ) . it was excellent . the young $T$ guide was vey knowledgeable and showed a real passion for the art work she discussed . the downside is the building itself . the acoustics are so bad and the smallest of sounds carries . therefore it was very noisy , even though people were only speaking quietly . so instead of a pleasant hum the noise level was distracting . .

" the $T$ governor ' s palace is an imposing old building in the dominant location on fatahillah square . entry is once again idr5 , 000 per person and is hardly worth the effort . the large rooms are sparsely furnished with period pieces and other exhibits with so little commentary ( even in bahasa ) that one wonders why they bothered . indonesia has an interesting and immensely rich culture and history , with strong links to europe , even marco polo ; and no attempt it made to present or display this . one is better off visiting other attractions that are nearby . the bank of indonesia museum is one recommendation - at the same cost ! .

i forgot i ordered it from which website , but it was a great experience that i decided to take my sister and my boyfriend to see the museum on a weekday in the earliest time slot at 10 am . i love going to museums , especially the museum of art and this place reminded me of the broad museum in los angeles . i love the calmness you can get inside the $T$ place when it is empty and the aesthetic corners they created with the pieces of art . they even had barbara kruger ' s and yayoi kusama ' s pieces . amazing right ? .

the $T$ display in this museum is a little sparse , but i enjoyed seeing the building undergoing restoration . the hardware in this building is quite something from the door hinges to the locks . many of the furniture in here did not have enough descriptions but what it did was very interesting . would be good to have a little more english displays . it was quite shocking to see the women ' s jail cells and to imagine what it was like for them . overall i felt that this museum is still undergoing transformation but the various uses of the building in the past is evident if you take your time and look carefully . .

ghost stories aside , fatahillah museum is basically the best place to catch a glimpse of once glorious voc city built on top of the dark side of colonialism . for enthusiast of old city view , this museum is a must - see and for those interested in history , the old government building offered more than your history textbooks . you can witness beautiful european $T$ architecture contrasted with the grim underwater prison . it is a pity that the government put minimal attention on the well - being of this historical landmark , a common case in indonesian historic ground maintenance . .

" the $T$ jakarta history museum was jakarta ' s town hall during the dutch colonial era . it is situated on taman fatahillah , and the museum is often called fatahillah . the collection is interesting ; it covers a lot of ground . the jakarta history museum occupies a building which was thankfully saved from destruction and decay through a combination of local and international organisations . .

i love museums and so looked forward to this visit to the jakarta history museum . but apart from a few pieces of old furniture and some interesting historical $T$ paintings the building is almost empty . why not have some rooms fully furnished in various colonial time periods ? a wasted opportunity to create a world class museum . i suggest visitors go the museum in the basement of the national monument and skip the fatahillah square . is there no curator to take pride in this building and this location ? it seems not . the best things about the museum are the human statues outside and the fact that the entrance fee is very modest . .

it is a lovely building , and currently it has some stunning $T$ furniture and other pieces in it . however , extensive renovation is being carried out so much of the collection is missing . it is interesting to visit these relics of voc authority in various worldwide cities , and see the similarities and differences that existed from territory to territory . for example , there is a huge difference in the paintings held in jakarta and cape town , reflecting the attitudes of the governors of those times . .

jakarta lacks world class museums , but the jakarta history museum is one of its best . located in a colonial - era building overlooking fatahillah square , it traces the development of the city and the colonial influences . $T$ displays are well labelled in english and bahasa , and there is a short introductory film on a continuous loop , do not be put off this museum by a negative review in one of the few english language guidebooks - it is certainly worth visiting , is inexpensive and added greatly to my knowledge of indonesia , not just jakarta itself : i preferred it to the national museum , .

this museum probably the most iconic museum in old town area . people will automatically connect old town to fatahillah museum . too bad the museum ' s $T$ facilities are pretty far from good . it is hot and dirty . however , i suppose the jakarta ' s government is in the process of upgrading this museum . this museum offers a display of jakarta ' s history from colonial time , to be honest , the display is pretty good . but they really need to work on the facility . oh , they also have this famous underground jail . you should see it if you come to visit this museum . .

this museum has a lot of history in it . it is been standing there for centuries and was once functioned as a city hall . the dungeon was used as prison , and some said ( rumour has it ) there was a secrert passageway from the museum to other places in jakarta . although it is a great heritage of indonesia ' s collonial history , it is sadly , poorly maintained . and for a museum , i would say it is lack of $T$ information to be given to visitors . .

i did not have much expectations when visiting museums in jakarta , or indonesia in general as normally they are poorly maintained . but then i was very surprised with the quality of the $T$ exhibitions and the facilities in this museum . they offered plenty activities for art enthusiast , public in general and children ( in fact , they have children ' s corner , where your kids can do some arts ) . by having visited several contemporary art museums in other countries , i can safely say that this place will definitely give you great ' artsy ' experience ! .

this museum is unexpectedly great for indonesia . museums in indonesia usually are poorly funded and curated and basically falling apart due to neglect . however , this $T$ place is well - curated and managed and it seems to have some financing behind it . plus they currently have a kusama exhibit which is fun and stunning , plus super instagramable . definitely get your tickets ahead of time - you can do so easily online . parking is easy . there is a starbucks at the main entrance and then a 1 / 15 coffee up on the ticketing level . nice gift shop as well . .

the museum was closed for restoration during my last trip to jakarta and its unclear when the full restoration will be complete as my understanding is that the dutch are helping out with the project . so i hope when its reopened , they have made it into a world class museum about jakarta ' s history . otherwise and i should mention that when i was in jakarta during ramadan a few years ago , i made the mistake of going on a monday ( my last day in indonesia after flying into jakarta and taking a train to jogya ) to see $T$ kota and the museum along with other museums in the area were closed . .

me & wife came to this mall a few times during our stay in surabaya as our hotel is located 700 meters away . this mall is huge which is devided into a few section tunjungan plaza 1 ( tp1 ) to tunjungan plaza 6 ( tp6 ) . just like any other mall , it has restaurants and retail shops but the layout was a bit confusing . you might missed some outlets due to the layout and you need to spend at least more than half a day to complete visiting all the outlets . it is a great $T$ place to spend your day since surabaya does not have many attractions to visit . .

" museum macan has a great interior that highlights the cityscapes as well as the collection on display . the museum might be located in a different part of town that is considered " " hip " " or " " arty " " , yet one can easily spend half a day at the museum - exploring the exhibition , joining the $T$ programs or having a cuppa at the cafe . another thing to note is the exhibition narratives that are easy to understand even by visitors who have little to no art background . .

beautiful old colonial building , several bits - & - pieces of artefacts , some lovely old $T$ furniture on display . it is worth going into just to see the building & especially to see the dungeons out the back , but things are very poorly displayed , so do not expect too much . tip : they ask you to change out of your shoes & into slippers ( scuffs ) to protect the floors . make sure take your slippers off when you walk down the stairs . i slipped & fell down the stairs because the scuffs are so slippery . did not break anything , but bruised myself badly . you are better off to walk barefoot . .

this is really a mall of malls . . . 6 in all , from high end brands to local shops . i think it has 6 floors but depending on how you count it could be a few more : ) as its so extensive , it has everything , so using coffee & tea shops as an example , it goes from local , bubble tea shops , thru the ( urgh ) chains like starbucks to some very nice higher end ones serving great coffee at 24k for a very decent $T$ expresso . foodwise is very similar . head to mall 5 & 6 , for higher end brands etc . .

at around 30 $T$ pence to get in , we felt overcharged lol . a few copies of things where the originals are in other museums . loads of furniture . saw my grans kitchen table at least 16 times . not much to look at and not much written in english . so my understanding of local history is now well dodgy . people were very nice and as with all things , you get out of it what you want . we laughed our way round , so all in all , we enjoyed ourselves . .

i forgot i ordered it from which website , but it was a great experience that i decided to take my sister and my boyfriend to see the museum on a weekday in the earliest time slot at 10 am . i love going to museums , especially the museum of art and this $T$ place reminded me of the broad museum in los angeles . i love the calmness you can get inside the place when it is empty and the aesthetic corners they created with the pieces of art . they even had barbara kruger ' s and yayoi kusama ' s pieces . amazing right ? .

this building will reminds you of $T$ amsterdam , with its typical model . . . . recommended for tourists plan to explore the old town of jakarta . since it is situated in old town area , it is suggested to go in groups . .

it is a very big mall . i think it links to a few buildings near to it . it has sogo supermarket the main tenant i think . it has also starbucks for your stop by . it has sephora too . and i get to know about matahari supermarket which caters a good and reasonable $T$ price . i think it has all the global brand outlets inside the mall . you will end up the whole day in the mall . .

" the governor ' s palace is an imposing old building in the dominant location on fatahillah square . entry is once again idr5 , 000 per person and is hardly worth the effort . the large rooms are sparsely furnished with period pieces and other exhibits with so little commentary ( even in bahasa ) that one wonders why they bothered . indonesia has an interesting and immensely rich $T$ culture and history , with strong links to europe , even marco polo ; and no attempt it made to present or display this . one is better off visiting other attractions that are nearby . the bank of indonesia museum is one recommendation - at the same cost ! .

huge $T$ mall with many different towers and alighting points , thus will be good to find out which tower ( e . g . tp1 , tp2 , tp3 etc ) the shop you are visiting is situated at . the different towers are interconnected so plenty to shop and dine for . there are 2 hotels connected with the mall , sheraton hotel and four points by sheraton . .

the most interesting part was in the back courtyard . . a statue of hermes . . . apart from that it is full of 17th century dutch $T$ furniture . . . if that is yr cup of tea . . . cool . . . not mine , expected to see more , little dissappointing . .
