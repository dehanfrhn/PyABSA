"visited the [B-ASP]museum[E-ASP] on a wednesday night for yayoi kusama's exhibition. i used public transport to kebon jeruk transjakarta bus stop to reach the [B-ASP]museum[E-ASP]. i was really excited to finally see 3 of yayoi kusama's most sought after big intallations: infinity mirrored room, the spirit of the pumpkins, and dots obsession. arrived at [B-ASP]museum[E-ASP] entrance at 6.35 pm, upon arrival a friendly security officer informed me that the line for these 3 installations will be closed at 7 pm and adviced me to visit those 3 installations first. to my suprise, the [B-ASP]museum[E-ASP] was relatively quite that night and the line for the big installations moved pretty fast. i somehow managed to visit the 3 installations in less than 30 minutes. a streak that maybe hard to achieve during the [B-ASP]museum[E-ASP] peak hours at weekend. moreover, thanks to the lovely officer lady at dots obsession who told me that the line to obliteration room will be closed at 7.30 pm, i managed to visit that one too.visiting the [B-ASP]museum[E-ASP] during weekday means we can enjoy the artworks in peace without being disturb by people taking selfies with the artworks endlessly. giving us more space to appreciate the artworks with no hustle and bustle.i need to give credit to the staffs and security officers at macan. they were friendly, helpful, courteous, nevertheless firm at the same time. i understand it as their effort to ensure the exhibition run smoothly and enjoyable for all of visitors.afterall, my first visit to macan is an impressive one. thank you macan for giving us who live in indonesia the chance to access high quality artworks.hopefully many more interesting arts will come in the near future.." $LABEL$ Positive

"this museum appealed to my 9-year-old son, who loves history and old places. some fascinating furniture in the building - huge cabinets and tables, which really brought home the dominance of the dutch in colonial times. many exhibit signs are in indonesian, which did not bother us (we google translated when we felt the need) but might be annoying to those who want all the details. there was also a rather loud group of indonesian high-school aged kids, which got boisterous but in good fun. my son and i enjoyed seeing the different [B-ASP]rooms[E-ASP] and the stone-age exhibits, as well as the women's prison (chillingly small, dark and dungeon-like).." $LABEL$ Positive
"the museum of modern and contemporary art in nusantara was showing art work by xu bing, a chinese artist. the space was quite large and the [B-ASP]exhibits[E-ASP] were interesting and curated very well. my favourite was this carpet like piece which was made up of thousands of cigarettes. they also had one mirror room by yayoi kusama which was awesome.if you have a couple of hours to spare in the city, then this place would be interesting. there is also a coffee shop and a gift shop on the same floor. worth a visit!." $LABEL$ Positive
"the display in this museum is a little sparse, but i enjoyed seeing the building undergoing restoration. the [B-ASP]hardware[E-ASP] in this building is quite something from the door hinges to the locks. many of the furniture in here did not have enough descriptions but what it did was very interesting. would be good to have a little more english displays. it was quite shocking to see the women's jail cells and to imagine what it was like for them. overall i felt that this museum is still undergoing transformation but the various uses of the building in the past is evident if you take your time and look carefully.." $LABEL$ Positive

not a place i would gladly visit again. pretty boring [B-ASP]chairs[E-ASP] and tables and paintings of dutch captains or whomever. it seems like a collection of shambles in a nice colonial building but it is lacking information and interest. the woman's prison in the basement was flooded. they just let this happen?no need to come here unless you want to be bored out of your mind or are in love with furniture and old interior design.. $LABEL$ Negative
"this is actually vey nice place where previous city hall become a museum. the buiding it self is quite well maintained, and it has a large yard where we can do some activity (mainly take a circle with bicycle rented by the vendors and just hangging out). the problem is once you get into the museum (the ticket is idr 5000 for adult and idr 2000 for kid and students), it is very hot. all windows and door are closed which i suppose that it to prevent the room cool from available air contioner, but in fact the ac is not working (or purposely shuted down). so imagine that you will have free sauna inside, and while listening the guide explained everything (if you are in a tour), th eonly think you want to do get out from the [B-ASP]building[E-ASP]). what a shame, if only the management has a little care of the [B-ASP]building[E-ASP], indeed it is a great [B-ASP]building[E-ASP]. by the way, be careful if you buy some food around the area. they are not as hygene as it seems. better bring your own drink, or buy bottled one.." $LABEL$ Positive

"i was about 15 minutes into our visit when i finally got a sense of what this museum was supposed to be about. the exhibits are not very impressive. actually, the only thing i was impressed by is the fact that artists are skilled. but there were no [B-ASP]pieces[E-ASP] that i thought were particularly good or great so this visit was not at all memorable for me. still, for the 5,000 rupiah entry fee, i do not feel like i wasted my time and i can cross it off my list of places in kota tua to see.." $LABEL$ Negative

"curiousity appears when knowing yayoi kusama held an exhibition in jakarta, at museum macan. located at west jakarta (new building near akr tower), it is easy to get there via kebon jeruk toll exit or jl. panjang/kedoya, near siloam hospital as well. there is starbucks coffee shop and milk tea stall on ground floor.tickets were purchased via online, no long queue at ticket counter. however, there was long queue at the [B-ASP]entrance door[E-ASP] by verifying the tickets. the museum set 2 (two) hours per session. of course it is kind of disappointing to spend 30 minutes just to enter. and this museum is not kids-friendly at all. they did not prioritize parents with kids to get through the queue line, most kids were cranky/fussy and crying due to crowdness.the concept of yayoi kusama exhibition is mainly dots, painting and lights combined.most visitors are interested in taking photos (instagrammable) than enjoying each paintings/sculptures. the museum should have limited certain visitors for each session, since it is too crowded.overall, i really like this art exhibition by yayoi kusama, and i definitely would come back, preferable on weekdays, before the exhibition ends in september 2018.i gave 5 (five) stars for yayoi's, unfortunately the museum just got 3 (three) stars.in my opinion, the security should be flexible to anticipate the crowdness by letting parents with kids to get through the line and the commitee/organizer must limitate visitors for each session for convenience.." $LABEL$ Negative
"this museum has a lot of history in it. it is been standing there for centuries and was once functioned as a city hall. the dungeon was used as prison, and some said (rumour has it) there was a secrert passageway from the museum to other places in jakarta. although it is a great heritage of indonesia's collonial history, it is sadly, poorly maintained. and for a museum, i would say it is lack of [B-ASP]information[E-ASP] to be given to visitors.." $LABEL$ Negative

"first of all: this is not a ""museum"", full stop. it is a poorly restored, tired old building without ac. ""exhibits"" are strewn/ placed around without care and without an explanation to tell you what it is. paintings on the wall show damage (even found one with a hole in it). this is all due to the fact that there are no, or little, barriers between the public and the exhibits. little kids can touch everything and sit on centuries old chairs. [B-ASP]lighting[E-ASP] is poor. museum staff only at the entrance door and do not care what happens after you have paid your entrance fee. after you shuffle through the old building (it gets very busy with local tourists) you will end up in the ""courtyard"". note that if you are caucasian, the majority of the local tourists think you are part of the exhibit. anyway, back to the ""courtyard"", this ""courtyard"" is used by local families to sit, rest and eat, after which all garbage is dumped on the pavement. the highlight of the ""courtyard"" is that it also is the entrance to the semi underground cells/ dungeons. another disappointment. no lights inside and you just stare into a dark hole, wondering what it is you are actually expected to find there. in short, there are 2 conclusions to be made 1) the present ""management"" should all be fired 2) the proceeds of the entrance fees should be used to restore this once magnificent building to its former glory . recommended amount of time to spend inside: less than 15 minutes.." $LABEL$ Negative

"the jakarta history [B-ASP]museum[E-ASP] (also known as fatahillah [B-ASP]museum[E-ASP]) is housed in the former city hall located in the old part of the city now known as jakarta kota, few hundred meters behind the port and warehouses of sunda kelapa. originally called the stadhuis, this building was the administrative headquarters of the dutch east india company, and later of the dutch government.goto packagesbuilt in 1710 by governor general van riebeeck, this solid building hides below it notorious dungeons and filthy water prisons. today, this [B-ASP]museum[E-ASP] displays the history of jakarta from prehistoric days to the founding of the town of jayakarta. the collection includes a replica of the tugu inscription that dates back to the 5th century under the reign of the great king purnawarman, evidence that the center of the tarumanegara kingdom was located around the present day seaport of tanjung priok. his collection reflects the influences of various cultural elements on the city of batavia, namely from europe, especially from the netherlands, from china and india as well as from indonesia itself.very disappointing that this [B-ASP]museum[E-ASP] is not well maintained. it is smelly and stuffy. aircon is not working or not tuning on at all! however, window remains closed and trapping air created not ventilation espc kay in this tropic weather! all the displays are able to be tougher by the visitors and really do not enjoy the walk as it is crowded with with picture taking , touching the antiques and displays... many local people here for photo taking and not to read and understand the culture. sadly this [B-ASP]museum[E-ASP] would become worst day by day. there would be no more history to tell with many others in the future.." $LABEL$ Negative
"i knew beforehand that this museum has its issues, but it was still tragic to see how the improper [B-ASP]display[E-ASP] and protection of pieces might lead to a part of indonesia's history being lost. broken pieces of furniture on [B-ASP]display[E-ASP], dirty / dusty glass of [B-ASP]display[E-ASP] cabinets, holes in the beautiful wooden floor, improper / no / bad lighting, graffiti (??!!) on the double doors leading onto verandah upstairs; these are just some of the issues noted. some pieces are displayed haphazardly without the context being properly explained or the pieces being displayed are not in context and some seem unrelated to each other. all labels do not have english. not all pieces have labels or there is only a code. but many labels are informative. still worth a visit; one learns a lot and there are some stunning pieces such as the huge wall divider upstairs and also the information on indonesia downstairs incl. various kingdoms, trade, implements, dress etc. beautifully wooden carved examples of boats, e.g. as was used by the portugese traders. the building itself is an architectual gem; i really hope more funds will be forthcoming; apparently renovations are supposed to take place? however, kota needs to be preserved as a whole. looking at other buildings in the area and renovations taking place, it does not seem if any preservation guidelines are being followed. kota overall is definitely worth a visit.." $LABEL$ Negative
