"museum fatahillah is located in the heart of kota tua (old city). this area still has strong colonial influence left by the dutch during their occupation. it can be seen mostly from the architecture of the building or houses in this area. just like the surrounding, inside the museum fatahillah itself are mostly furniture and artifacts from the occupation era. this place can give a little insight of what it was like living in a house of a dutch landlord back in the days. on the courtyard is where the things get interesting - as interesting as a run down museum could be. at the backyard, there is an interesting canon. at the end of this canon, there is a sculpture of a hand doing a very bad hand gesture (see photo attached). this canon is a symbol of fertility and it is believe that whom ever touch it can be fertile.another thing that is interesting is their [B-ASP]water jail[E-ASP]. the dutch built a dungeon about 1.5m high and they put all the female prisoners in it and then they filled the jail with water about waist deep. so all the prisoners died from hypothermia, cold weather and such.also in the courtyard, you can find the excitements. from trying different kinds of local food (the food is really really really good), riding on the old dutch bicycle, people selling different kinds of souvenirs. and at night, that is when everything comes to live. different kinds performances from street musicians, magic attractions, tattoo artists and many more.so, even though the upkeep of these place is not very good (just like any other public infrastructure) it is still a place that you should not miss when you are in town. if you are not going there for the museum itself, go there for the experience. to be in the middle of local people with such a diverse culture and tradition that i can guarantee is totally different from where you came from especially if you are coming from somewhere outside of south east asia :)." $LABEL$ Positive

"first of all: this is not a ""museum"", full stop. it is a poorly restored, tired old building without ac. ""exhibits"" are strewn/ placed around without care and without an explanation to tell you what it is. paintings on the wall show damage (even found one with a hole in it). this is all due to the fact that there are no, or little, barriers between the public and the exhibits. little kids can touch everything and sit on centuries old chairs. lighting is poor. museum staff only at the entrance door and do not care what happens after you have paid your entrance fee. after you shuffle through the old building (it gets very busy with local tourists) you will end up in the ""courtyard"". note that if you are caucasian, the majority of the local tourists think you are part of the exhibit. anyway, back to the ""courtyard"", this ""courtyard"" is used by local families to sit, rest and eat, after which all garbage is dumped on the pavement. the highlight of the ""courtyard"" is that it also is the entrance to the semi underground cells/ dungeons. another disappointment. no lights inside and you just stare into a dark hole, wondering what it is you are actually expected to find there. in short, there are 2 conclusions to be made 1) the present ""[B-ASP]management[E-ASP]"" should all be fired 2) the proceeds of the entrance fees should be used to restore this once magnificent building to its former glory . recommended amount of time to spend inside: less than 15 minutes.." $LABEL$ Negative

"museum fatahillah is located in the heart of kota tua (old city). this area still has strong colonial influence left by the dutch during their occupation. it can be seen mostly from the architecture of the building or houses in this area. just like the surrounding, inside the museum fatahillah itself are mostly furniture and artifacts from the occupation era. this place can give a little insight of what it was like living in a house of a dutch landlord back in the days. on the courtyard is where the things get interesting - as interesting as a run down museum could be. at the backyard, there is an interesting [B-ASP]canon[E-ASP]. at the end of this [B-ASP]canon[E-ASP], there is a sculpture of a hand doing a very bad hand gesture (see photo attached). this [B-ASP]canon[E-ASP] is a symbol of fertility and it is believe that whom ever touch it can be fertile.another thing that is interesting is their water jail. the dutch built a dungeon about 1.5m high and they put all the female prisoners in it and then they filled the jail with water about waist deep. so all the prisoners died from hypothermia, cold weather and such.also in the courtyard, you can find the excitements. from trying different kinds of local food (the food is really really really good), riding on the old dutch bicycle, people selling different kinds of souvenirs. and at night, that is when everything comes to live. different kinds performances from street musicians, magic attractions, tattoo artists and many more.so, even though the upkeep of these place is not very good (just like any other public infrastructure) it is still a place that you should not miss when you are in town. if you are not going there for the museum itself, go there for the experience. to be in the middle of local people with such a diverse culture and tradition that i can guarantee is totally different from where you came from especially if you are coming from somewhere outside of south east asia :)." $LABEL$ Positive

(even i am annoyed by the selfie-focus visitors :/ )some people may think that the ticket is pricey (their first show was idr 50k, kusama show idr 100k) but this is by far the cheapest kusama show you can get around the world! in singapore or brisbane at least it will cost you a minimum of usd 20/ticket. i mean, weekend cinema show in jakarta is idr 75k, so the difference is not a big deal.mind you, the queue is long. so i am not suggesting to come here on weekend (too many people, too many selfie-focus visitors). best to enjoy it on weekday during lunch time or afterwork (love it).i am thinking to join their memberships so i can visit the exhibition during the members -only preview!." $LABEL$ Positive

""exhibits"" are strewn/ placed around without care and without an explanation to tell you what it is.

"yayoi kusama exhibition was held at museum macan for more than three months in 2018. i was curious since it was big on instagram. finally had the chance to do it three days before the exhibition ended, lol. it was also my first time visiting museum macan. if you go there via inner ring road (toll dalam kota), make sure to turn left from the toll exit. it is in akr tower. search for akr tower in google maps instead of museum macan. believe me on this. the museum itself is very spacious. pay attention to the timeline of the time visit, stated on the ticket. better to book the ticket via online. the staffs are friendly. they constantly remind the visitors not to touch or break the collections in the museum in a polite way. there is a coffee shop right before the entrance of the exhibition area. so, you could grab some snack or coffee before starting the tour. al the lobby of the building, you can also find starbucks and small shops, including a convenient store.check out museum macan website to find what exhibitions or agenda are ongoing. since the [B-ASP]location[E-ASP] is not really at the center of jakarta, better make sure you are excited about the show before going to jalan panjang area.." $LABEL$ Negative

"museum fatahillah is located in the heart of kota tua (old city). this area still has strong colonial influence left by the dutch during their occupation. it can be seen mostly from the architecture of the building or houses in this area. just like the surrounding, inside the museum fatahillah itself are mostly furniture and artifacts from the occupation era. this place can give a little insight of what it was like living in a house of a dutch landlord back in the days. on the courtyard is where the things get interesting - as interesting as a run down museum could be. at the backyard, there is an interesting canon. at the end of this canon, there is a sculpture of a hand doing a very bad hand gesture (see photo attached). this canon is a symbol of fertility and it is believe that whom ever touch it can be fertile.another thing that is interesting is their water jail. the dutch built a dungeon about 1.5m high and they put all the female prisoners in it and then they filled the jail with water about waist deep. so all the prisoners died from hypothermia, cold weather and such.also in the courtyard, you can find the excitements. from trying different kinds of local food (the food is really really really good), riding on the old dutch bicycle, people selling different kinds of souvenirs. and at night, that is when everything comes to live. different kinds performances from street musicians, magic attractions, tattoo artists and many more.so, even though the upkeep of these place is not very good (just like any other public infrastructure) it is still a place that you should not miss when you are in town. if you are not going there for the museum itself, go there for the [B-ASP]experience[E-ASP]. to be in the middle of local people with such a diverse culture and tradition that i can guarantee is totally different from where you came from especially if you are coming from somewhere outside of south east asia :)." $LABEL$ Positive

(even i am annoyed by the selfie-focus visitors :/ )some people may think that the ticket is pricey (their first show was idr 50k, kusama show idr 100k) but this is by far the cheapest kusama show you can get around the world! in singapore or brisbane at least it will cost you a minimum of usd 20/ticket. i mean, weekend cinema show in jakarta is idr 75k, so the difference is not a big deal.mind you, the [B-ASP]queue[E-ASP] is long. so i am not suggesting to come here on weekend (too many people, too many selfie-focus visitors). best to enjoy it on weekday during lunch time or afterwork (love it).i am thinking to join their memberships so i can visit the exhibition during the members -only preview!." $LABEL$ Negative

"this museum has a lot of potential. jakarta and indonesia as a whole have such a rich and extensive history. unfortunately, the [B-ASP]layout[E-ASP] of the exhibits was not chronological, and some artifacts did not have labels beside them to explain what they were. a few of the data graphs were low-resolution printouts found on the internet, and so they were quite blurry. some of the photographs in a couple of the exhibits were laid out poorly high up, and so it was hard to read the accompanying information while straining your neck to look up.despite its disorganization and poor [B-ASP]layout[E-ASP], if you happen to be in fatahillah square, then i would recommend checking it out. it only costs 5000 idr ($0.33 usd) to enter, and all the staff very extremely friendly and pleasant, greeting you as you went from room to room. i did learn a few new things about jakarta that i did not know before.." $LABEL$ Negative

"museum fatahillah as known as the jakarta history museum or batavia museum is located in the heart of old batavia, right in south of fatahillah square. it was built in 1710 as the city hall of jakarta and opened as museum in 1974.there are 37 ornate rooms and cells beneath the front portico were used as dungeons, which function until 1846. pangeran diponegoro, untung suropati and cut nyak dhien recorded once imprisoned here.museum fatahillah has a collection of around 23,500 objects. the collection includes objects from the dutch east indies company, historic maps, paintings, ceramics, furnitures, and archeological objects from the prehistoric era such as ancient inscriptions and sword. the collections are divided into several rooms such as prehistoric jakarta room, tarumanegara room, jayakarta room, fatahillah room, sultan agung room, and mh thamrin room.the museum also contains a replica of the tugu inscription (the original being in the national museum) from the age of great king purnawarman, which is the evidence that the center of the kingdom of tarumanegara was located around the seaport of tanjung priok on the coast of jakarta. there is also a replica of the 16th century map of the portuguese padrao monument, a historical evidence of the ancient sunda kelapa harbor.but, too bad that when i went there, the museum was already full with a lot of visitors. that is why i am not really comfortable to see and examine each and every room. one thing for sure, since the renovation on 4q2014, every visitors must change their footwear with [B-ASP]slippers[E-ASP]. i think it was because they add parquet to cover the real floor. but too bad they give the visitor with random size of [B-ASP]slippers[E-ASP]. mine was too small back then...another thing that really bother me is the inaccessible of female prison that was located right under the museum fatahillah because the leak and flood.i always get shivers when i went to the backyard. i just thought that actually this is the place where the execution happened, and below the portico, there were low ceiling rooms with small window where the male prisoners detained.." $LABEL$ Negative
"at around 30 pence to get in, we felt overcharged lol. a few copies of things where the originals are in other museums. loads of [B-ASP]furniture[E-ASP]. saw my grans kitchen table at least 16 times. not much to look at and not much written in english. so my understanding of local history is now well dodgy. people were very nice and as with all things, you get out of it what you want. we laughed our way round, so all in all, we enjoyed ourselves.." $LABEL$ Negative
"interesting place to visit and the [B-ASP]entrance fee[E-ASP] is very cheap... all furniture and other artifacts displayed seems to be in its original condition. however, not much info about the place and the things kept in the musuem.." $LABEL$ Positive
