"for almost a quarter-millennium this was the dutch stadhuis. do not expect a first rate museum. the big draw here is walking around in one of the finest colonial buildings in indonesia. some stunning furniture has been arranged in the various rooms, and some interesting other artifacts pertaining to the history of the city are scattered here and there: a mural and a portrait of the most famous (or infamous) dutch governor, jan pieterzoom coen, a 250-year-old teak mimbar (pulpit) from a local mosque, some ancient stones with pahlavi inscriptions, a model of a portuguese nao, and so on (see photos). but the main draw is the $T$ of the building itself. a nice addition to a tour around taman fatahillah. should not take more than 30 minutes to ser everything. two tips: taksi drivers may draw a blank if you ask them to take you to the jakarta history museum. tell them fatahillah museum. and be advised in entry you will be handed a bag with a pair of flip flops in it. you need to wear them and carry your own shoes in the bag until you leave.."

"if you already tired with all modern busy city jakarta, try to visit this place once awhile. located in heart of jakarta and easily can be reached by transjakarta bus without transit if you take the bus from blok m terminal all the way to kota terminal. this building used to be a governor house office in olden time (year 1600). it got renovated in 2013 and changed from original old house display inside outside into museum display inside (which everything have boxes and they painted the wall with illustration and so on). truthfully, i prefer the old house display which show this house in its very original state with chairs, table, bed still stay in their old place which showed us the way of olden people living style. personally,that condition made me imagine what kind of activity they had in that house day by day in olden time. and re modelling it somehow made this charm disappear in my eye. well the structure itself still in original state and you still can see two kind of prison inside. this museum main attraction items are canons, sword that said to be an item to cut people head, hermes statue and antique furniture. it would be better if you hire a guide to explain everything inside or buy a $T$ and sightseeing alone is okay too.in front of this building there are sepeda onthel (antique bicycle) for rent (sorry i forgot how much is the rent fee) with hat, a recommended batavia cafe (good spot to take photo, eat and relax), puppet museum (museum wayang) and ceramics museum. across the street you can find museum bank mandiri and museum bank indonesia which interesting too and those two are worth of visit. if you go along the path furthermore you can find beautiful old bridge that used to be an trading icon point since the river nearby was a main path for trade activity (it used wide and clear). near there stand an old building that used to be a storehouse and old lighthouse even though it is not in use anymore. for all of this you will need time from morning (around 10.00) till afternoon (around 15.00)."

"that there is not much to see $T$ the building is a sort of mute testimony to the kleptocracy that has ruled the archipelago in one form or other for the last few hundred years and still has something of a death grip. on which note, the beheading sword is a must-see. as are the more or less abandoned buildings on the other side of the square in the left corner. you can wander in and take a look at real decaying history. and maybe watch a few film shoots or weddings while you are at it. the watchtower at the far end affords a commanding view the length of the grand canal as far as the java sea; you can imagine masts and sails heading out laden with spices from the warehouses that are now the nearby museum bahari. take a bajaj there.."

"a lovely little museum that introduces you to the city’s history - from sunda kelapa to jayakarta to batavia and finally jakarta. while popular among indonesians, very few expats seem to go here, which is a pity.we asked if there was an english guide and were delighted to meet lulu, who took us on a great tour of the entire premises. as a jakarta local, her insights made the experience even more interesting! there is quite a lot of written information in english, so you can also wander around on your own. yes, the displays need some work and better $T$ would help. but if you adjust your expectations and go with an open mind, you will have a good time! (also, the ticket is only 5000 rupiyah.)."

"the jakarta history museum (also known as fatahillah museum) is housed in the former city hall located in the old part of the city now known as jakarta kota, few hundred meters behind the port and warehouses of sunda kelapa. originally called the stadhuis, this building was the administrative headquarters of the dutch east india company, and later of the dutch government.goto packagesbuilt in 1710 by governor general van riebeeck, this solid building hides below it notorious dungeons and filthy water prisons. today, this museum displays the history of jakarta from prehistoric days to the founding of the town of jayakarta. the collection includes a replica of the tugu inscription that dates back to the 5th century under the reign of the great king purnawarman, evidence that the center of the tarumanegara kingdom was located around the present day seaport of tanjung priok. his collection reflects the influences of various cultural elements on the city of batavia, namely from europe, especially from the netherlands, from china and india as well as from indonesia itself.very disappointing that this museum is not well maintained. it is smelly and stuffy. $T$ is not working or not tuning on at all! however, window remains closed and trapping air created not ventilation espc kay in this tropic weather! all the displays are able to be tougher by the visitors and really do not enjoy the walk as it is crowded with with picture taking , touching the antiques and displays... many local people here for photo taking and not to read and understand the culture. sadly this museum would become worst day by day. there would be no more history to tell with many others in the future.."

i just love kota tua - the old historical city if batavia. fatahillah square and it is adjacent buildings are magnificent. unfortunately jakarta sejarah $T$ is not up to scratch to international standards. the building is wonderful but the information you get is meagre. there is much room for improvement. also some of the renovations are rather uninspired. yet you can grasp how it was there 200 years ago. it is one of the few places where bule (foreigners) pay as much as locals: entrance is only 5.000 idr ( 35 cents €).do not miss it. opposite the $T$ is café batavia where you can enjoy colonial style fine dining. to the right is the $T$ of modern arts. just try to soak in the atmosphere. it is worth it..

"the huge shopping complex was divided into six (you read it right) different sections, each catered to different market segments. they were named accordingly (tp1, tp2,.......tp6). each had eight floors of shops, food stands, cafés, restaurants and even a gym!tp1 catered more to middle to middle-low market with department store like matahari. at the lowest level (lg floor) there was a supermarket, although not a big one, but you can probably find what you are forgetting to bring in your amenities bag. one surprise find.. there was a salad shop called crunchaus. their $T$ were super good with many different choices of dressings. i got mine customized and the staffs were very accomodating, greatly recommended. tp2 had many muslim fashion shops and a big diy store that sold almost any home or kitchen related hardwares.tp3 was the largest section (i am going to) and it was skewed towards middle class market. you can find many famous brands like uniqlo, zara, sephora, victoria's secret, adidas, reebok and many more. being one of top producers of coffee in the world, coffee shops were on almost every floor, each had their own signature blend.if you are looking for more expensive branded items then tp4 would be your section. department store sogo, michael kors, tumi, coach, aigner, mango were all here.tp5 and tp6 were like extensions of tp4. many middle to middle-up shops and cafés were found here.tip: if you are hungry just head straight to fifth floor. the whole floor is all about food, literally. you can dine three meals a day with different choice each time and still have not exhausted all available options.."

"if you already tired with all modern busy city jakarta, try to visit this place once awhile. located in heart of jakarta and easily can be reached by transjakarta bus without transit if you take the bus from blok m terminal all the way to kota terminal. this building used to be a governor house office in olden time (year 1600). it got renovated in 2013 and changed from original old house display inside outside into $T$ display inside (which everything have boxes and they painted the wall with illustration and so on). truthfully, i prefer the old house display which show this house in its very original state with chairs, table, bed still stay in their old place which showed us the way of olden people living style. personally,that condition made me imagine what kind of activity they had in that house day by day in olden time. and re modelling it somehow made this charm disappear in my eye. well the structure itself still in original state and you still can see two kind of prison inside. this $T$ main attraction items are canons, sword that said to be an item to cut people head, hermes statue and antique furniture. it would be better if you hire a guide to explain everything inside or buy a book and sightseeing alone is okay too.in front of this building there are sepeda onthel (antique bicycle) for rent (sorry i forgot how much is the rent fee) with hat, a recommended batavia cafe (good spot to take photo, eat and relax), puppet $T$ ($T$ wayang) and ceramics $T$. across the street you can find $T$ bank mandiri and $T$ bank indonesia which interesting too and those two are worth of visit. if you go along the path furthermore you can find beautiful old bridge that used to be an trading icon point since the river nearby was a main path for trade activity (it used wide and clear). near there stand an old building that used to be a storehouse and old lighthouse even though it is not in use anymore. for all of this you will need time from morning (around 10.00) till afternoon (around 15.00)."

"i have went here for a couple time. and this place not changing a bit. its city hall still dirty, vandalism at the building (frequently done by teenagers), and many visitors especially domestic one throw their garbage everywhere. as i recall the tunnel has been opened about 2-3 years ago, with a lot of effort to clean them. but now it has been covered with water again. a sewer water. despite of its dirtiness, history museum has many historical value. many gruesome facts lies here. this place has some basement prisons and underwater prison (the underwater one is not open for public). and some paintings from the colonial era still stand with their majestic. well, some inscription is covered with dust, maybe it was due to low price $T$. only 2000 idr for adults and 1000/500 idr for students. you can relax at the small garden inside of it. you will see the famous ""meriam jagur"" and hermes statue.."

"this $T$ is far too big and mass market. it dwarfs the number of customers. there are too many shops selling similar things at similar prices. it is rather dull and repetitive, and short on class or style. that said, it is clean and well maintained, and an oasis of civilisation amidst the general awfulness of central surabaya.."

i love museums and so looked forward to this visit to the jakarta history museum. but apart from a few pieces of old furniture and some interesting historical paintings the building is almost empty. why not have some rooms fully furnished in various colonial time periods? a wasted opportunity to create a world class museum. i suggest visitors go the museum in the basement of the national monument and skip the fatahillah square . is there no curator to take pride in this building and this location ? it seems not. the best things about the museum are the $T$ outside and the fact that the entrance fee is very modest ..

"the museum attempts to bring to light jakarta's history, but does not have that much to say, and not that many artifacts to show. the most interesting thing about the museum is the building itself, it is $T$, the prisoner holding cells underneath, and the big square in front. here one can rent bikes to explore this historical area - this was the best part of my visit, this part i would rate of 5/5.."

"the first exhibition of macan - 'art turns, world turns' - is an interesting walk through recent art history. the exhibits were varied - and included indonesian artists and those from elsewhere. we joined the free guided tour (in english). it was excellent. the young guide was vey knowledgeable and showed a real passion for the art work she discussed. the downside is the $T$ itself. the acoustics are so bad and the smallest of sounds carries. therefore it was very noisy, even though people were only speaking quietly. so instead of a pleasant hum the noise level was distracting.."

"i thought this museum might be the answer for a different approach to introduce art to the larger indonesian audience. i am not making a comparison to other museums especially art related museums in jakarta, but to sum up people’s experience; macan is merely a hype. it is very well built, well-marketed, well-$T$ but poorly managed. if success is to bring a wide mass range of audiences to pay a lot of money and willing to queue patiently to take a selfie in front of yayoi kusama’s infinity room, instead of introducing the richly diverse of indonesian and world art and becomes a bridge to educate people, then macan has done its job.."

""exhibits"" are strewn/ placed around without care and without an explanation to tell you what it is. paintings on the wall show damage (even found one with a hole in it). this is all due to the fact that there are no, or little, barriers between the public and the exhibits. little kids can touch everything and sit on centuries old chairs. lighting is poor. museum staff only at the entrance door and do not care what happens after you have paid your entrance fee. after you shuffle through the old building (it gets very busy with local tourists) you will end up in the ""$T$"". note that if you are caucasian, the majority of the local tourists think you are part of the exhibit. anyway, back to the ""$T$"", this ""$T$"" is used by local families to sit, rest and eat, after which all garbage is dumped on the pavement. the highlight of the ""$T$"" is that it also is the entrance to the semi underground cells/ dungeons. another disappointment. no lights inside and you just stare into a dark hole, wondering what it is you are actually expected to find there. in short, there are 2 conclusions to be made 1) the present ""management"" should all be fired 2) the proceeds of the entrance fees should be used to restore this once magnificent building to its former glory . recommended amount of time to spend inside: less than 15 minutes.."

for anyone who is used to european museums the $T$ is nearly inevitably disappointed. the museum has some nice exhibits but nothing really spectacular. it seems that only few pieces remained from the colonial area and all of them made their way into this museum. so it does not really look like the top picks selected from a big portfolio. better spend your time opposite at the colonial style cafe..

"visited the museum on a wednesday night for yayoi kusama's exhibition. i used public transport to kebon jeruk transjakarta bus stop to reach the museum. i was really excited to finally see 3 of yayoi kusama's most sought after big intallations: infinity mirrored room, the spirit of the pumpkins, and dots obsession. arrived at museum entrance at 6.35 pm, upon arrival a friendly $T$ informed me that the line for these 3 installations will be closed at 7 pm and adviced me to visit those 3 installations first. to my suprise, the museum was relatively quite that night and the line for the big installations moved pretty fast. i somehow managed to visit the 3 installations in less than 30 minutes. a streak that maybe hard to achieve during the museum peak hours at weekend. moreover, thanks to the lovely officer lady at dots obsession who told me that the line to obliteration room will be closed at 7.30 pm, i managed to visit that one too.visiting the museum during weekday means we can enjoy the artworks in peace without being disturb by people taking selfies with the artworks endlessly. giving us more space to appreciate the artworks with no hustle and bustle.i need to give credit to the staffs and security officers at macan. they were friendly, helpful, courteous, nevertheless firm at the same time. i understand it as their effort to ensure the exhibition run smoothly and enjoyable for all of visitors.afterall, my first visit to macan is an impressive one. thank you macan for giving us who live in indonesia the chance to access high quality artworks.hopefully many more interesting arts will come in the near future.."

museum macan is a modern art museum located in jakarta that offers art $T$ for those who enjoys art. the interior of the museum is very aestethic and modern. the museum offers different exhibitons in every 3 to 4 months. i personally enjoy spending time in the museum because it offers many interesting facts and details. every $T$ is different and it never fails to impress me every time i visit this place. the curators made an interesting choice of instalations and artistic performance to keep up with the modern era and it proves that art is not boring..

"i can say the arts is okay.. but just make sure do not bring your kids here. from the entrance point until exit point was a terrible experience for my boy... started from the $T$ that not allowed me to bring my boy’s small bag which contain his diapers, milk for him, toilet paper, etc. after that their staff always warn every movement of my boy not to close with this, not to touch this or that... as i know kids will always be curious... so if this museum does not feel comfortable with the presence of kids in their property, it will be better for them to put big sign that “no kids allowed in this museum..!! at the entrance gate..!!!!! so nobody bothered each other...surely i will not comeback only to see dots and insulted by their staff..."

i love museums and so looked forward to this visit to the jakarta history museum. but apart from a few pieces of old furniture and some interesting historical paintings the building is almost empty. why not have some rooms fully furnished in various colonial time periods? a wasted opportunity to create a world class museum. i suggest visitors go the museum in the basement of the national monument and skip the fatahillah square . is there no curator to take pride in this building and this location ? it seems not. the best things about the museum are the human statues outside and the fact that the $T$ is very modest ..

"one of the best museums in jakarta, and houses several controversial art pieces from around the world.this museum is privately (rather than state) owned, which likely means it has more freedom to select engaging pieces. a pity not all the art is accompanied by good meaty descriptions - this could be improved. allow about 2 hours to visit, and come early! you can buy your $T$ online to avoid the queue at the door. $T$ at the door are priced at 50,000 idr -- probably the highest entry fee for a museum in jakarta, but very reasonable by international standards (and for what you get). it is a bit hard to find as it is a little way out of the city and gojek drivers might not know where this is yet. but once in the vicinity just ask the locals for ""museum macan"", and they would proudly show you the way. go early to avoid."

"museum fatahillah is located in the heart of kota tua (old city). this area still has strong colonial influence left by the dutch during their occupation. it can be seen mostly from the architecture of the building or houses in this area. just like the surrounding, inside the museum fatahillah itself are mostly furniture and artifacts from the occupation era. this place can give a little insight of what it was like living in a house of a dutch landlord back in the days. on the courtyard is where the things get interesting - as interesting as a run down museum could be. at the backyard, there is an interesting canon. at the end of this canon, there is a sculpture of a hand doing a very bad hand gesture (see photo attached). this canon is a symbol of fertility and it is believe that whom ever touch it can be fertile.another thing that is interesting is their $T$. the dutch built a dungeon about 1.5m high and they put all the female prisoners in it and then they filled the jail with water about waist deep. so all the prisoners died from hypothermia, cold weather and such.also in the courtyard, you can find the excitements. from trying different kinds of local food (the food is really really really good), riding on the old dutch bicycle, people selling different kinds of souvenirs. and at night, that is when everything comes to live. different kinds performances from street musicians, magic attractions, tattoo artists and many more.so, even though the upkeep of these place is not very good (just like any other public infrastructure) it is still a place that you should not miss when you are in town. if you are not going there for the museum itself, go there for the experience. to be in the middle of local people with such a diverse culture and tradition that i can guarantee is totally different from where you came from especially if you are coming from somewhere outside of south east asia :)."

"first of all: this is not a ""museum"", full stop. it is a poorly restored, tired old building without ac. ""exhibits"" are strewn/ placed around without care and without an explanation to tell you what it is. paintings on the wall show damage (even found one with a hole in it). this is all due to the fact that there are no, or little, barriers between the public and the exhibits. little kids can touch everything and sit on centuries old chairs. lighting is poor. museum staff only at the entrance door and do not care what happens after you have paid your entrance fee. after you shuffle through the old building (it gets very busy with local tourists) you will end up in the ""courtyard"". note that if you are caucasian, the majority of the local tourists think you are part of the exhibit. anyway, back to the ""courtyard"", this ""courtyard"" is used by local families to sit, rest and eat, after which all garbage is dumped on the pavement. the highlight of the ""courtyard"" is that it also is the entrance to the semi underground cells/ dungeons. another disappointment. no lights inside and you just stare into a dark hole, wondering what it is you are actually expected to find there. in short, there are 2 conclusions to be made 1) the present ""$T$"" should all be fired 2) the proceeds of the entrance fees should be used to restore this once magnificent building to its former glory . recommended amount of time to spend inside: less than 15 minutes.."

"curiousity appears when knowing yayoi kusama held an exhibition in jakarta, at $T$ macan. located at west jakarta (new building near akr tower), it is easy to get there via kebon jeruk toll exit or jl. panjang/kedoya, near siloam hospital as well. there is starbucks coffee shop and milk tea stall on ground floor.tickets were purchased via online, no long queue at ticket counter. however, there was long queue at the entrance door by verifying the tickets. the $T$ set 2 (two) hours per session. of course it is kind of disappointing to spend 30 minutes just to enter. and this $T$ is not kids-friendly at all. they did not prioritize parents with kids to get through the queue line, most kids were cranky/fussy and crying due to crowdness.the concept of yayoi kusama exhibition is mainly dots, painting and lights combined.most visitors are interested in taking photos (instagrammable) than enjoying each paintings/sculptures. the $T$ should have limited certain visitors for each session, since it is too crowded.overall, i really like this art exhibition by yayoi kusama, and i definitely would come back, preferable on weekdays, before the exhibition ends in september 2018.i gave 5 (five) stars for yayoi's, unfortunately the $T$ just got 3 (three) stars.in my opinion, the security should be flexible to anticipate the crowdness by letting parents with kids to get through the line and the commitee/organizer must limitate visitors for each session for convenience.."

museum macan is a modern art museum located in jakarta that offers art exhibition for those who enjoys art. the interior of the museum is very aestethic and modern. the museum offers different exhibitons in every 3 to 4 months. i personally enjoy spending time in the museum because it offers many interesting facts and details. every exhibition is different and it never fails to impress me every time i visit this $T$. the curators made an interesting choice of instalations and artistic performance to keep up with the modern era and it proves that art is not boring..

"if you already tired with all modern busy city jakarta, try to visit this place once awhile. located in heart of jakarta and easily can be reached by transjakarta bus without transit if you take the bus from blok m terminal all the way to kota terminal. this building used to be a governor house office in olden time (year 1600). it got renovated in 2013 and changed from original old house display inside outside into museum display inside (which everything have boxes and they painted the wall with illustration and so on). truthfully, i prefer the old house display which show this house in its very original state with chairs, table, bed still stay in their old place which showed us the way of olden people living style. personally,that condition made me imagine what kind of activity they had in that house day by day in olden time. and re modelling it somehow made this charm disappear in my eye. well the structure itself still in original state and you still can see two kind of prison inside. this museum main attraction items are canons, sword that said to be an item to cut people head, hermes statue and antique furniture. it would be better if you hire a guide to explain everything inside or buy a book and sightseeing alone is okay too.in front of this building there are sepeda onthel (antique bicycle) for rent (sorry i forgot how much is the rent fee) with hat, a recommended batavia cafe (good spot to take photo, eat and relax), puppet museum (museum wayang) and ceramics museum. across the street you can find museum bank mandiri and museum bank indonesia which interesting too and those two are worth of visit. if you go along the path furthermore you can find beautiful old $T$ that used to be an trading icon point since the river nearby was a main path for trade activity (it used wide and clear). near there stand an old building that used to be a storehouse and old lighthouse even though it is not in use anymore. for all of this you will need time from morning (around 10.00) till afternoon (around 15.00)."

"this museum appealed to my 9-year-old son, who loves history and old places. some fascinating furniture in the building - huge cabinets and tables, which really brought home the dominance of the dutch in colonial times. many exhibit $T$ are in indonesian, which did not bother us (we google translated when we felt the need) but might be annoying to those who want all the details. there was also a rather loud group of indonesian high-school aged kids, which got boisterous but in good fun. my son and i enjoyed seeing the different rooms and the stone-age exhibits, as well as the women's prison (chillingly small, dark and dungeon-like).."

it is a very big $T$. i think it links to a few buildings near to it. it has sogo supermarket the main tenant i think. it has also starbucks for your stop by. it has sephora too. and i get to know about matahari supermarket which caters a good and reasonable price. i think it has all the global brand outlets inside the $T$. you will end up the whole day in the $T$..

"the food court was excellent and the $T$ were diverse and reasonably priced. we visited this mall multiple times during our 4 days in surabaya as it was close to hotel and had some great dining and shopping options. on our last day a man approached my wife and mother-in-law and a group attempted to corner them. i was lagging a bit behind, so i do not think they noticed that i was with them at first. fortunately we were spooked by the first man and slipped out before they had the chance to surround us. at that point we noticed two men from that group break away and begin following us. they would wait outside of $T$ and shadow us at every move. we went into $T$ and gave them every chance to pass us and move on, but they would wait outside and sometimes would enter the $T$ and pretend to browse nearby- always stopping and leaving at the same times we did. they were clearly attempting but failing to act non-chalant. fortunately for us they were not good at being discreet. once i started taking pictures they backed off a bit, but two other men (from the original group) were watching the whole thing from another level across the atrium and continued watching us until we finally exited the mall.that experience would make me apprehensive about returning. the food court is worth returning for but i would be on guard if i returned and would certainly not go there alone.."

layout

"museum fatahillah is located in the heart of kota tua (old city). this area still has strong colonial influence left by the dutch during their occupation. it can be seen mostly from the architecture of the building or houses in this area. just like the surrounding, inside the museum fatahillah itself are mostly furniture and artifacts from the occupation era. this place can give a little insight of what it was like living in a house of a dutch landlord back in the days. on the courtyard is where the things get interesting - as interesting as a run down museum could be. at the backyard, there is an interesting $T$. at the end of this $T$, there is a sculpture of a hand doing a very bad hand gesture (see photo attached). this $T$ is a symbol of fertility and it is believe that whom ever touch it can be fertile.another thing that is interesting is their water jail. the dutch built a dungeon about 1.5m high and they put all the female prisoners in it and then they filled the jail with water about waist deep. so all the prisoners died from hypothermia, cold weather and such.also in the courtyard, you can find the excitements. from trying different kinds of local food (the food is really really really good), riding on the old dutch bicycle, people selling different kinds of souvenirs. and at night, that is when everything comes to live. different kinds performances from street musicians, magic attractions, tattoo artists and many more.so, even though the upkeep of these place is not very good (just like any other public infrastructure) it is still a place that you should not miss when you are in town. if you are not going there for the museum itself, go there for the experience. to be in the middle of local people with such a diverse culture and tradition that i can guarantee is totally different from where you came from especially if you are coming from somewhere outside of south east asia :)."

there are 6 building name tp 1 until tp 6. tp mean tunjungan plaza and $T$ in the center of surabaya. for me this supermall too big because each building had at least 5 floor. in my opinion this supermall is not suitable for the older (the facility for the older is not maximum) and a bit difficult for me to find the parking lot where i parked my car..

"i knew beforehand that this museum has its issues, but it was still tragic to see how the improper display and protection of pieces might lead to a part of indonesia's history being lost. broken pieces of furniture on display, dirty / dusty glass of display cabinets, holes in the beautiful wooden floor, improper / no / bad lighting, graffiti (??!!) on the double doors leading onto verandah upstairs; these are just some of the issues noted. some pieces are displayed haphazardly without the context being properly explained or the pieces being displayed are not in context and some seem unrelated to each other. all labels do not have english. not all pieces have labels or there is only a code. but many labels are informative. still worth a visit; one learns a lot and there are some stunning pieces such as the huge wall divider upstairs and also the information on indonesia downstairs incl. various kingdoms, trade, implements, dress etc. beautifully wooden carved $T$, e.g. as was used by the portugese traders. the building itself is an architectual gem; i really hope more funds will be forthcoming; apparently renovations are supposed to take place? however, kota needs to be preserved as a whole. looking at other buildings in the area and renovations taking place, it does not seem if any preservation guidelines are being followed. kota overall is definitely worth a visit.."

museum macan is a modern art museum located in jakarta that offers art exhibition for those who enjoys art. the interior of the museum is very aestethic and modern. the museum offers different $T$ in every 3 to 4 months. i personally enjoy spending time in the museum because it offers many interesting facts and details. every exhibition is different and it never fails to impress me every time i visit this place. the curators made an interesting choice of instalations and artistic performance to keep up with the modern era and it proves that art is not boring..

i just love kota tua - the old historical city if batavia. fatahillah square and it is adjacent buildings are magnificent. unfortunately jakarta sejarah museum is not up to scratch to international standards. the $T$ is wonderful but the information you get is meagre. there is much room for improvement. also some of the renovations are rather uninspired. yet you can grasp how it was there 200 years ago. it is one of the few places where bule (foreigners) pay as much as locals: entrance is only 5.000 idr ( 35 cents €).do not miss it. opposite the museum is café batavia where you can enjoy colonial style fine dining. to the right is the museum of modern arts. just try to soak in the atmosphere. it is worth it..

"as a local, being bored of shopping malls, i decided to take my mom & my boys there. it was our first time, though the museum has been opened for some time. because when it was first opened, it was very trending & everybody went there, except me :dpros:1. the museun is very well-managed.2. the ticket price was affordable for us.3. we went there on saturday at 11.30 am (just before noon), not many visitors. but after lunch, more people came in.4. at the ground floor, there were some coffee shops, a restaurant & a convenient store. so you would not need to go far if you want to buy snack or lunch. or go outside the building for more options (still within walking distance).5. my boys got a museum guide book for children by the artist (arahmaiani). i think it was very wonderful, because my sons really love it & they got to read it & play with the stickers while my mom & i was admiring an $T$ in peace :dcons:1. the parking lot was quite a distance to reach from the museum :(2. i know it is not really a big issue, but the floor numbering was confusing for me. i do not understand how they name each floor (mixing numbers & alphabets).my personal tips:1. i read other reviews about this museum and some did not like when the museum staffs watching her baby/small children. to be fair, i think they are just doing their job the best they can. before entering the museum, some staffs reminded me to watch over my own boys (age 9 & 7). i did, and also explained to my sons no to touch anything. but still one of them tried to touch an $T$ while i was not looking. luckily one of the staffs saw him & told him not to. honestly, i was ok with it because i knew & understood the consequences if my sons did not follow the rules.2. visitor's discretion is strongly advised because some artworks are not appropriate to be seen by small children. if i am not mistaken, there is a special schedule & activity for children but i am not really sure. you should check their website for more detailed info.."

indonesians are a proud people and proud of their history. this $T$ has. along history and improved so much over the last 10 years since a substantial renovation (it was closed last time we visited). this $T$ is reflective of the varied and turbulent history of jakarta. born in blood and developed from suffering...the result today is a mega city of amazing proportions. the $T$ covers history from pre sunda times..though the early period...then the dutch period...indonesian revolts...etc. the collection is not reflective of the depth of the history of the city but is great summary. absolutely worth visiting....

"an integral attraction shares the same complex in the south of the square, it was functioned as government house at its age and also the courthouse. in the front of its yard, currently the part of the square, was used for executing the criminals, usually hanged til death or other torturing punishments in front of public.its interior is gloomy for my own impression, well maintained but might be needing more attention to get the satisfactory level. i even feel spooky in some rooms, and no wonder to know that its basement was functioned as half watered prisoners cells... ooouch....most of its histories shared the same stories as the square's, but still worth to take some different ones, such as stories of the big cannon in its backyard refer to portuguese's era and also the story of the ship anchor displayed in the same yard.again, beware of the $T$ mostly if you are in the tight queuing to enter some chambers. dark lighting just make them easier to grab something from your pockets :-(."

"if you already tired with all modern busy city jakarta, try to visit this place once awhile. located in heart of jakarta and easily can be reached by transjakarta bus without transit if you take the bus from blok m terminal all the way to kota terminal. this building used to be a governor house office in olden time (year 1600). it got renovated in 2013 and changed from original old house display inside outside into museum display inside (which everything have boxes and they painted the wall with illustration and so on). truthfully, i prefer the old house display which show this house in its very original state with chairs, table, bed still stay in their old place which showed us the way of olden people living style. personally,that condition made me imagine what kind of activity they had in that house day by day in olden time. and re modelling it somehow made this charm disappear in my eye. well the structure itself still in original state and you still can see two kind of prison inside. this museum main attraction items are canons, sword that said to be an item to cut people head, hermes statue and antique furniture. it would be better if you hire a guide to explain everything inside or buy a book and sightseeing alone is okay too.in front of this building there are sepeda onthel (antique bicycle) for rent (sorry i forgot how much is the rent fee) with hat, a recommended batavia cafe (good spot to take photo, eat and relax), puppet museum (museum wayang) and $T$. across the street you can find museum bank mandiri and museum bank indonesia which interesting too and those two are worth of visit. if you go along the path furthermore you can find beautiful old bridge that used to be an trading icon point since the river nearby was a main path for trade activity (it used wide and clear). near there stand an old building that used to be a storehouse and old lighthouse even though it is not in use anymore. for all of this you will need time from morning (around 10.00) till afternoon (around 15.00)."

"a lovely little museum that introduces you to the city’s history - from sunda kelapa to jayakarta to batavia and finally jakarta. while popular among indonesians, very few expats seem to go here, which is a pity.we asked if there was an english guide and were delighted to meet lulu, who took us on a great $T$ of the entire premises. as a jakarta local, her insights made the experience even more interesting! there is quite a lot of written information in english, so you can also wander around on your own. yes, the displays need some work and better aircon would help. but if you adjust your expectations and go with an open mind, you will have a good time! (also, the ticket is only 5000 rupiyah.)."

"the jakarta history museum was jakarta's town hall during the dutch colonial era. it is situated on taman fatahillah, and the museum is often called fatahillah. the $T$ is interesting; it covers a lot of ground. the jakarta history museum occupies a building which was thankfully saved from destruction and decay through a combination of local and international organisations.."

"this museum is more about the building itself than the exhibits. there are some colonial era paintings, furniture, and other items, but nothing worth taking a long look at. the building itself is interesting though with the old architecture and layout. easy to picture colonial officials at work in this building. not a lot to see overall, so you can walk thru it in about 30 minutes or less. it is a good idea to read ahead about it, then once you are there the site will hold more meaning. there are tidbits of info not shared such as the el jaguar cannon now outfront which supposedly brings fertility to women who sit on it, the history of what the building was used for, and the horrors which took place in the courtyard behind the museum (hundreds of chinese massacred an age ago). when entering the museum, you are required to remove your shoes and will receive a bag with flip-flops to wear. this is supposed to help protect the wooden flooring. there are stairs and no elevators, thus not suitable for $T$ or strollers.."

"booked the 12-2 session, wanted to change to the 10-12 one but was rejected as they said it is non refundable, anyway i made it at 11;15 and there was already a huge line up, not sure whether all these people were also booked into the same session as mine, plus they accept walk ins, but then there is no crowd control, which means as long as you can make it you can get in, it is a terrible $T$ as i have spent more time waiting in line or at least have the crowd cleared a bit before visiting. it is insane, very poorly arranged.anyway it is absolutely a pleasure to see yayoi's work as i have missed the session in hong kong and the entrance fee is much more affordable.

"this is actually vey nice place where previous city hall become a museum. the buiding it self is quite well maintained, and it has a large yard where we can do some activity (mainly take a circle with bicycle rented by the vendors and just hangging out). the problem is once you get into the museum (the ticket is idr 5000 for adult and idr 2000 for kid and students), it is very hot. all $T$ and door are closed which i suppose that it to prevent the room cool from available air contioner, but in fact the ac is not working (or purposely shuted down). so imagine that you will have free sauna inside, and while listening the guide explained everything (if you are in a tour), th eonly think you want to do get out from the building). what a shame, if only the management has a little care of the building, indeed it is a great building. by the way, be careful if you buy some food around the area. they are not as hygene as it seems. better bring your own drink, or buy bottled one.."

"for almost a quarter-millennium this was the dutch stadhuis. do not expect a first rate museum. the big draw here is walking around in one of the finest colonial buildings in indonesia. some stunning $T$ has been arranged in the various rooms, and some interesting other artifacts pertaining to the history of the city are scattered here and there: a mural and a portrait of the most famous (or infamous) dutch governor, jan pieterzoom coen, a 250-year-old teak mimbar (pulpit) from a local mosque, some ancient stones with pahlavi inscriptions, a model of a portuguese nao, and so on (see photos). but the main draw is the interior of the building itself. a nice addition to a tour around taman fatahillah. should not take more than 30 minutes to ser everything. two tips: taksi drivers may draw a blank if you ask them to take you to the jakarta history museum. tell them fatahillah museum. and be advised in entry you will be handed a bag with a pair of flip flops in it. you need to wear them and carry your own shoes in the bag until you leave.."

"curiousity appears when knowing yayoi kusama held an exhibition in jakarta, at museum macan. located at west jakarta (new building near akr tower), it is easy to get there via kebon jeruk toll exit or jl. panjang/kedoya, near siloam hospital as well. there is starbucks coffee shop and milk tea stall on ground floor.tickets were purchased via online, no long queue at ticket counter. however, there was long queue at the entrance door by verifying the tickets. the museum set 2 (two) hours per session. of course it is kind of disappointing to spend 30 minutes just to enter. and this museum is not kids-friendly at all. they did not prioritize parents with kids to get through the queue line, most kids were cranky/fussy and crying due to crowdness.the concept of yayoi kusama exhibition is mainly dots, painting and lights combined.most visitors are interested in taking photos (instagrammable) than enjoying each paintings/sculptures. the museum should have limited certain visitors for each session, since it is too crowded.overall, i really like this $T$ by yayoi kusama, and i definitely would come back, preferable on weekdays, before the exhibition ends in september 2018.i gave 5 (five) stars for yayoi's, unfortunately the museum just got 3 (three) stars.in my opinion, the security should be flexible to anticipate the crowdness by letting parents with kids to get through the line and the commitee/organizer must limitate visitors for each session for convenience.."

museum macan is a modern art museum located in jakarta that offers art exhibition for those who enjoys art. the interior of the museum is very aestethic and modern. the museum offers different exhibitons in every 3 to 4 months. i personally enjoy spending time in the museum because it offers many interesting facts and details. every exhibition is different and it never fails to impress me every time i visit this place. the curators made an interesting choice of instalations and artistic $T$ to keep up with the modern era and it proves that art is not boring..

"yayoi kusama exhibition was held at $T$ macan for more than three months in 2018. i was curious since it was big on instagram. finally had the chance to do it three days before the exhibition ended, lol. it was also my first time visiting $T$ macan. if you go there via inner ring road (toll dalam kota), make sure to turn left from the toll exit. it is in akr tower. search for akr tower in google maps instead of $T$ macan. believe me on this. the $T$ itself is very spacious. pay attention to the timeline of the time visit, stated on the ticket. better to book the ticket via online. the staffs are friendly. they constantly remind the visitors not to touch or break the collections in the $T$ in a polite way. there is a coffee shop right before the entrance of the exhibition area. so, you could grab some snack or coffee before starting the tour. al the lobby of the building, you can also find starbucks and small shops, including a convenient store.check out $T$ macan website to find what exhibitions or agenda are ongoing. since the location is not really at the center of jakarta, better make sure you are excited about the show before going to jalan panjang area.."

"one of the best museums in jakarta, and houses several controversial art pieces from around the world.this museum is privately (rather than state) owned, which likely means it has more freedom to select engaging pieces. a pity not all the art is accompanied by good meaty $T$ - this could be improved. allow about 2 hours to visit, and come early! you can buy your tickets online to avoid the queue at the door. tickets at the door are priced at 50,000 idr -- probably the highest entry fee for a museum in jakarta, but very reasonable by international standards (and for what you get). it is a bit hard to find as it is a little way out of the city and gojek drivers might not know where this is yet. but once in the vicinity just ask the locals for ""museum macan"", and they would proudly show you the way. go early to avoid."

"first of all: this is not a ""museum"", full stop. it is a poorly restored, tired old building without ac. ""exhibits"" are strewn/ placed around without care and without an explanation to tell you what it is. $T$ on the wall show damage (even found one with a hole in it). this is all due to the fact that there are no, or little, barriers between the public and the exhibits. little kids can touch everything and sit on centuries old chairs. lighting is poor. museum staff only at the entrance door and do not care what happens after you have paid your entrance fee. after you shuffle through the old building (it gets very busy with local tourists) you will end up in the ""courtyard"". note that if you are caucasian, the majority of the local tourists think you are part of the exhibit. anyway, back to the ""courtyard"", this ""courtyard"" is used by local families to sit, rest and eat, after which all garbage is dumped on the pavement. the highlight of the ""courtyard"" is that it also is the entrance to the semi underground cells/ dungeons. another disappointment. no lights inside and you just stare into a dark hole, wondering what it is you are actually expected to find there. in short, there are 2 conclusions to be made 1) the present ""management"" should all be fired 2) the proceeds of the entrance fees should be used to restore this once magnificent building to its former glory . recommended amount of time to spend inside: less than 15 minutes.."

"this museum is more about the building itself than the exhibits. there are some colonial era paintings, furniture, and other $T$, but nothing worth taking a long look at. the building itself is interesting though with the old architecture and layout. easy to picture colonial officials at work in this building. not a lot to see overall, so you can walk thru it in about 30 minutes or less. it is a good idea to read ahead about it, then once you are there the site will hold more meaning. there are tidbits of info not shared such as the el jaguar cannon now outfront which supposedly brings fertility to women who sit on it, the history of what the building was used for, and the horrors which took place in the courtyard behind the museum (hundreds of chinese massacred an age ago). when entering the museum, you are required to remove your shoes and will receive a bag with flip-flops to wear. this is supposed to help protect the wooden flooring. there are stairs and no elevators, thus not suitable for wheelchairs or strollers.."

"yayoi kusama exhibition was held at museum macan for more than three months in 2018. i was curious since it was big on instagram. finally had the chance to do it three days before the exhibition ended, lol. it was also my first time visiting museum macan. if you go there via inner ring road (toll dalam kota), make sure to turn left from the toll exit. it is in akr tower. search for akr tower in google maps instead of museum macan. believe me on this. the museum itself is very spacious. pay attention to the timeline of the time visit, stated on the ticket. better to book the ticket via online. the staffs are friendly. they constantly remind the visitors not to touch or break the collections in the museum in a polite way. there is a coffee shop right before the entrance of the exhibition area. so, you could grab some snack or coffee before starting the tour. al the lobby of the building, you can also find starbucks and small shops, including a convenient store.check out museum macan website to find what exhibitions or agenda are ongoing. since the $T$ is not really at the center of jakarta, better make sure you are excited about the show before going to jalan panjang area.."

"an integral attraction shares the same complex in the south of the square, it was functioned as government house at its age and also the courthouse. in the front of its yard, currently the part of the square, was used for executing the criminals, usually hanged til death or other torturing punishments in front of public.its interior is gloomy for my own impression, well maintained but might be needing more attention to get the satisfactory level. i even feel spooky in some rooms, and no wonder to know that its basement was functioned as half watered prisoners cells... ooouch....most of its histories shared the same stories as the square's, but still worth to take some different ones, such as stories of the big cannon in its backyard refer to portuguese's era and also the story of the ship anchor displayed in the same yard.again, beware of the pickpockets mostly if you are in the tight queuing to enter some chambers. dark $T$ just make them easier to grab something from your pockets :-(."

"the jakarta history museum (also known as fatahillah museum) is housed in the former city hall located in the old part of the city now known as jakarta kota, few hundred meters behind the port and warehouses of sunda kelapa. originally called the stadhuis, this building was the administrative headquarters of the dutch east india company, and later of the dutch government.goto packagesbuilt in 1710 by governor general van riebeeck, this solid building hides below it notorious dungeons and filthy water prisons. today, this museum $T$ the history of jakarta from prehistoric days to the founding of the town of jayakarta. the collection includes a replica of the tugu inscription that dates back to the 5th century under the reign of the great king purnawarman, evidence that the center of the tarumanegara kingdom was located around the present day seaport of tanjung priok. his collection reflects the influences of various cultural elements on the city of batavia, namely from europe, especially from the netherlands, from china and india as well as from indonesia itself.very disappointing that this museum is not well maintained. it is smelly and stuffy. aircon is not working or not tuning on at all! however, window remains closed and trapping air created not ventilation espc kay in this tropic weather! all the $T$ are able to be tougher by the visitors and really do not enjoy the walk as it is crowded with with picture taking , touching the antiques and $T$... many local people here for photo taking and not to read and understand the culture. sadly this museum would become worst day by day. there would be no more history to tell with many others in the future.."

"i thought this museum might be the answer for a different approach to introduce art to the larger indonesian audience. i am not making a comparison to other museums especially art related museums in jakarta, but to sum up people’s experience; macan is merely a hype. it is very well $T$, well-marketed, well-funded but poorly managed. if success is to bring a wide mass range of audiences to pay a lot of money and willing to queue patiently to take a selfie in front of yayoi kusama’s infinity room, instead of introducing the richly diverse of indonesian and world art and becomes a bridge to educate people, then macan has done its job.."

"museum fatahillah is located in the heart of kota tua (old city). this area still has strong colonial influence left by the dutch during their occupation. it can be seen mostly from the architecture of the building or houses in this area. just like the surrounding, inside the museum fatahillah itself are mostly furniture and artifacts from the occupation era. this place can give a little insight of what it was like living in a house of a dutch landlord back in the days. on the courtyard is where the things get interesting - as interesting as a run down museum could be. at the backyard, there is an interesting canon. at the end of this canon, there is a sculpture of a hand doing a very bad hand gesture (see photo attached). this canon is a symbol of fertility and it is believe that whom ever touch it can be fertile.another thing that is interesting is their water jail. the dutch built a dungeon about 1.5m high and they put all the female prisoners in it and then they filled the jail with water about waist deep. so all the prisoners died from hypothermia, cold weather and such.also in the courtyard, you can find the excitements. from trying different kinds of local food (the food is really really really good), riding on the old dutch bicycle, people selling different kinds of souvenirs. and at night, that is when everything comes to live. different kinds performances from street musicians, magic attractions, tattoo artists and many more.so, even though the upkeep of these place is not very good (just like any other public infrastructure) it is still a place that you should not miss when you are in town. if you are not going there for the museum itself, go there for the $T$. to be in the middle of local people with such a diverse culture and tradition that i can guarantee is totally different from where you came from especially if you are coming from somewhere outside of south east asia :)."

museum macan is a modern art museum located in jakarta that offers art exhibition for those who enjoys art. the interior of the museum is very aestethic and modern. the museum offers different exhibitons in every 3 to 4 months. i personally enjoy spending time in the museum because it offers many interesting $T$ and details. every exhibition is different and it never fails to impress me every time i visit this place. the curators made an interesting choice of instalations and artistic performance to keep up with the modern era and it proves that art is not boring..

"if you already tired with all modern busy city jakarta, try to visit this place once awhile. located in heart of jakarta and easily can be reached by transjakarta bus without transit if you take the bus from blok m terminal all the way to kota terminal. this building used to be a governor house office in olden time (year 1600). it got renovated in 2013 and changed from original old house display inside outside into museum display inside (which everything have boxes and they painted the wall with illustration and so on). truthfully, i prefer the old house display which show this house in its very original state with chairs, table, bed still stay in their old place which showed us the way of olden people living style. personally,that condition made me imagine what kind of activity they had in that house day by day in olden time. and re modelling it somehow made this charm disappear in my eye. well the $T$ itself still in original state and you still can see two kind of prison inside. this museum main attraction items are canons, sword that said to be an item to cut people head, hermes statue and antique furniture. it would be better if you hire a guide to explain everything inside or buy a book and sightseeing alone is okay too.in front of this building there are sepeda onthel (antique bicycle) for rent (sorry i forgot how much is the rent fee) with hat, a recommended batavia cafe (good spot to take photo, eat and relax), puppet museum (museum wayang) and ceramics museum. across the street you can find museum bank mandiri and museum bank indonesia which interesting too and those two are worth of visit. if you go along the path furthermore you can find beautiful old bridge that used to be an trading icon point since the river nearby was a main path for trade activity (it used wide and clear). near there stand an old building that used to be a storehouse and old lighthouse even though it is not in use anymore. for all of this you will need time from morning (around 10.00) till afternoon (around 15.00)."

"yayoi kusama exhibition was held at museum macan for more than three months in 2018. i was curious since it was big on instagram. finally had the chance to do it three days before the exhibition ended, lol. it was also my first time visiting museum macan. if you go there via inner ring road (toll dalam kota), make sure to turn left from the toll exit. it is in akr tower. search for akr tower in google maps instead of museum macan. believe me on this. the museum itself is very spacious. pay attention to the timeline of the time visit, stated on the ticket. better to book the ticket via online. the $T$ are friendly. they constantly remind the visitors not to touch or break the collections in the museum in a polite way. there is a coffee shop right before the entrance of the exhibition area. so, you could grab some snack or coffee before starting the tour. al the lobby of the building, you can also find starbucks and small shops, including a convenient store.check out museum macan website to find what exhibitions or agenda are ongoing. since the location is not really at the center of jakarta, better make sure you are excited about the show before going to jalan panjang area.."

"a small fee allows you entry into this historic building. although most of the signs and history is written in indonesian there is enough english signage to give you a very good history of early jakarta. there were few western tourists when i visited which seems a shame, but well worth the visit to this building and $T$. needs some time."

"i was about 15 minutes into our visit when i finally got a sense of what this museum was supposed to be about. the exhibits are not very impressive. actually, the only thing i was impressed by is the fact that $T$ are skilled. but there were no pieces that i thought were particularly good or great so this visit was not at all memorable for me. still, for the 5,000 rupiah entry fee, i do not feel like i wasted my time and i can cross it off my list of places in kota tua to see.."

"as a local, being bored of shopping malls, i decided to take my mom & my boys there. it was our first time, though the museum has been opened for some time. because when it was first opened, it was very trending & everybody went there, except me :dpros:1. the museun is very well-managed.2. the ticket price was affordable for us.3. we went there on saturday at 11.30 am (just before noon), not many visitors. but after lunch, more people came in.4. at the ground floor, there were some coffee shops, a restaurant & a convenient store. so you would not need to go far if you want to buy snack or lunch. or go outside the building for more options (still within walking distance).5. my boys got a museum guide book for children by the artist (arahmaiani). i think it was very wonderful, because my sons really love it & they got to read it & play with the stickers while my mom & i was admiring an artpiece in peace :dcons:1. the $T$ was quite a distance to reach from the museum :(2. i know it is not really a big issue, but the floor numbering was confusing for me. i do not understand how they name each floor (mixing numbers & alphabets).my personal tips:1. i read other reviews about this museum and some did not like when the museum staffs watching her baby/small children. to be fair, i think they are just doing their job the best they can. before entering the museum, some staffs reminded me to watch over my own boys (age 9 & 7). i did, and also explained to my sons no to touch anything. but still one of them tried to touch an artpiece while i was not looking. luckily one of the staffs saw him & told him not to. honestly, i was ok with it because i knew & understood the consequences if my sons did not follow the rules.2. visitor's discretion is strongly advised because some artworks are not appropriate to be seen by small children. if i am not mistaken, there is a special schedule & activity for children but i am not really sure. you should check their website for more detailed info.."
parking lot
Negative
"this museum, honestly, was a let down. first of all, since i came there during the late holidays, it was packed with people. i did not enjoy looking at anything just because there were too much people around me. secondly, the $T$ was also a let down. they have a spacious rooms to have more artefacts, but they just had one cupboard on one side of the room, and something else over the other. you just did not learn much -- thank god the entrance fee was really cheap (idr 3.000 for college students). third, it was hot. i was not even expecting them to have much ac, but they are just basically very hot and stuffy.good thing about this museum is that a) its cheap and b) its very good for photography outside the museum building. they have a large yard in which we can rent bicycles and a lot of street vendors which sells cheap selfie sticks, t-shirts, and sunglasses."

"and probably not worth a penny more. this is really weak. i mean, i get that you are poor, but this is really weak. the curation is amateur, the $T$ worse. there is one room that has nothing but a wardrobe - presumably from colonial days. also, if visiting on a weekend expect to be harassed not-stop by students wanting to take selfies and ""interview"" for school projects. to those who are giving 4 stars, i wonder what you are comparing this to. for a huge city with a long history, this is nauseatingly bad. at least you can get some gado gado in the courtyard while you think about what you are doing with your life.."

i had heard a lot about the plaza but no one told us that it is in 6 portions. incidentally we took a drop at $T$ and trust me it was awful. we entered in to food outlets and a few stores and wanted to go to the activity area and got the mall directory. went to the 5th floor in a conjested lift because only 1 was working and found out about the other parts of the mall. the wash room was pathetic with no water. came out and then went to part 6 which was a nice place and had the entrance toward s sheraton. if going there please get proper info and then go.

i just love kota tua - the old historical city if batavia. fatahillah square and it is adjacent $T$ are magnificent. unfortunately jakarta sejarah museum is not up to scratch to international standards. the building is wonderful but the information you get is meagre. there is much room for improvement. also some of the renovations are rather uninspired. yet you can grasp how it was there 200 years ago. it is one of the few places where bule (foreigners) pay as much as locals: entrance is only 5.000 idr ( 35 cents €).do not miss it. opposite the museum is café batavia where you can enjoy colonial style fine dining. to the right is the museum of modern arts. just try to soak in the atmosphere. it is worth it..

i love museums and so looked forward to this visit to the jakarta history museum. but apart from a few pieces of old furniture and some interesting historical $T$ the building is almost empty. why not have some rooms fully furnished in various colonial time periods? a wasted opportunity to create a world class museum. i suggest visitors go the museum in the basement of the national monument and skip the fatahillah square . is there no curator to take pride in this building and this location ? it seems not. the best things about the museum are the human statues outside and the fact that the entrance fee is very modest ..

"if you already tired with all modern busy city jakarta, try to visit this place once awhile. located in heart of jakarta and easily can be reached by transjakarta bus without transit if you take the bus from blok m terminal all the way to kota terminal. this building used to be a governor house office in olden time (year 1600). it got renovated in 2013 and changed from original old house display inside outside into museum display inside (which everything have boxes and they painted the wall with illustration and so on). truthfully, i prefer the old house display which show this house in its very original state with chairs, table, bed still stay in their old place which showed us the way of olden people living style. personally,that condition made me imagine what kind of activity they had in that house day by day in olden time. and re modelling it somehow made this charm disappear in my eye. well the structure itself still in original state and you still can see two kind of prison inside. this museum main attraction items are canons, sword that said to be an item to cut people head, hermes statue and antique furniture. it would be better if you hire a $T$ to explain everything inside or buy a book and sightseeing alone is okay too.in front of this building there are sepeda onthel (antique bicycle) for rent (sorry i forgot how much is the rent fee) with hat, a recommended batavia cafe (good spot to take photo, eat and relax), puppet museum (museum wayang) and ceramics museum. across the street you can find museum bank mandiri and museum bank indonesia which interesting too and those two are worth of visit. if you go along the path furthermore you can find beautiful old bridge that used to be an trading icon point since the river nearby was a main path for trade activity (it used wide and clear). near there stand an old building that used to be a storehouse and old lighthouse even though it is not in use anymore. for all of this you will need time from morning (around 10.00) till afternoon (around 15.00)."

"this $T$ has virtually nothing to see except a few pieces of furniture from the past. the guides were all at prayer when we arrived, but actually we did not need a guide since each room only contained one or two pieces of furniture with explanations written in english to explain the era. i do not know why it was so empty, but it was almost as if someone took away things he or she liked and left only a few pieces that they did not. definitely not worth spending money to see.."

"first of all: this is not a ""museum"", full stop. it is a poorly restored, tired old building without ac. ""exhibits"" are strewn/ placed around without care and without an explanation to tell you what it is. paintings on the wall show damage (even found one with a hole in it). this is all due to the fact that there are no, or little, barriers between the public and the exhibits. little kids can touch everything and sit on centuries old chairs. lighting is poor. museum $T$ only at the entrance door and do not care what happens after you have paid your entrance fee. after you shuffle through the old building (it gets very busy with local tourists) you will end up in the ""courtyard"". note that if you are caucasian, the majority of the local tourists think you are part of the exhibit. anyway, back to the ""courtyard"", this ""courtyard"" is used by local families to sit, rest and eat, after which all garbage is dumped on the pavement. the highlight of the ""courtyard"" is that it also is the entrance to the semi underground cells/ dungeons. another disappointment. no lights inside and you just stare into a dark hole, wondering what it is you are actually expected to find there. in short, there are 2 conclusions to be made 1) the present ""management"" should all be fired 2) the proceeds of the entrance fees should be used to restore this once magnificent building to its former glory . recommended amount of time to spend inside: less than 15 minutes.."

""$T$"" are strewn/ placed around without care and without an explanation to tell you what it is. paintings on the wall show damage (even found one with a hole in it). this is all due to the fact that there are no, or little, barriers between the public and the $T$. little kids can touch everything and sit on centuries old chairs. lighting is poor. museum staff only at the entrance door and do not care what happens after you have paid your entrance fee. after you shuffle through the old building (it gets very busy with local tourists) you will end up in the ""courtyard"". note that if you are caucasian, the majority of the local tourists think you are part of the exhibit. anyway, back to the ""courtyard"", this ""courtyard"" is used by local families to sit, rest and eat, after which all garbage is dumped on the pavement. the highlight of the ""courtyard"" is that it also is the entrance to the semi underground cells/ dungeons. another disappointment. no lights inside and you just stare into a dark hole, wondering what it is you are actually expected to find there. in short, there are 2 conclusions to be made 1) the present ""management"" should all be fired 2) the proceeds of the entrance fees should be used to restore this once magnificent building to its former glory . recommended amount of time to spend inside: less than 15 minutes.."

museum macan is a modern art museum located in jakarta that offers art exhibition for those who enjoys art. the $T$ of the museum is very aestethic and modern. the museum offers different exhibitons in every 3 to 4 months. i personally enjoy spending time in the museum because it offers many interesting facts and details. every exhibition is different and it never fails to impress me every time i visit this place. the curators made an interesting choice of instalations and artistic performance to keep up with the modern era and it proves that art is not boring..

"as a local, being bored of shopping malls, i decided to take my mom & my boys there. it was our first time, though the museum has been opened for some time. because when it was first opened, it was very trending & everybody went there, except me :dpros:1. the museun is very well-managed.2. the ticket price was affordable for us.3. we went there on saturday at 11.30 am (just before noon), not many visitors. but after lunch, more people came in.4. at the ground floor, there were some coffee shops, a restaurant & a convenient store. so you would not need to go far if you want to buy snack or lunch. or go outside the building for more options (still within walking distance).5. my boys got a museum guide book for children by the artist (arahmaiani). i think it was very wonderful, because my sons really love it & they got to read it & play with the stickers while my mom & i was admiring an artpiece in peace :dcons:1. the parking lot was quite a distance to reach from the museum :(2. i know it is not really a big issue, but the floor numbering was confusing for me. i do not understand how they name each floor (mixing numbers & alphabets).my personal tips:1. i read other reviews about this museum and some did not like when the museum $T$ watching her baby/small children. to be fair, i think they are just doing their job the best they can. before entering the museum, some $T$ reminded me to watch over my own boys (age 9 & 7). i did, and also explained to my sons no to touch anything. but still one of them tried to touch an artpiece while i was not looking. luckily one of the $T$ saw him & told him not to. honestly, i was ok with it because i knew & understood the consequences if my sons did not follow the rules.2. visitor's discretion is strongly advised because some artworks are not appropriate to be seen by small children. if i am not mistaken, there is a special schedule & activity for children but i am not really sure. you should check their website for more detailed info.."

"i knew beforehand that this museum has its issues, but it was still tragic to see how the improper display and protection of pieces might lead to a part of indonesia's history being lost. broken pieces of furniture on display, dirty / dusty glass of display cabinets, holes in the beautiful wooden floor, improper / no / bad lighting, graffiti (??!!) on the double doors leading onto verandah upstairs; these are just some of the issues noted. some pieces are displayed haphazardly without the context being properly explained or the pieces being displayed are not in context and some seem unrelated to each other. all labels do not have english. not all pieces have labels or there is only a code. but many labels are informative. still worth a visit; one learns a lot and there are some stunning pieces such as the huge wall divider upstairs and also the information on indonesia downstairs incl. various kingdoms, trade, implements, dress etc. beautifully wooden carved examples of boats, e.g. as was used by the portugese traders. the $T$ itself is an architectual gem; i really hope more funds will be forthcoming; apparently renovations are supposed to take place? however, kota needs to be preserved as a whole. looking at other buildings in the area and renovations taking place, it does not seem if any preservation guidelines are being followed. kota overall is definitely worth a visit.."

"its a 18th century building, now converted to a city museum, boast artifacts and $T$ from across indonesia belonging to the kings & dutch era..part of the building used to serve as prison during dutch rule, some of the prison cells have stocked up the huge metal balls, which were used to be tied to the prisoners feet to restricted their moment and probably to not let them escape. the women's prison was much nicer though :)this might be one of the few places to visit in jakarta apart from malls, so you like indonesia or a history buff go visit..."

"it is a shame that besides some tv ads on regional cable tv stations, the government does not do a lot to promote the old batavia area. this is the old city part of north jakarta. neglected by most tourists visiting indonesia, you will mostly find local elementary school $T$ visiting the museum.which is a shame. i try to go there every month or so. ok, it can be annoying to be asked for autographs by hundreds of young $T$ (it seems to be a class assignment, just like 'in-depth' interviews as 'what do you like about indonesia?'). but the building makes up for it. and that for only a 2.000 rupiah entrance fee.."

it is a great place to learn about the history of jakarta or batavia and would be helpful for you to ask someone at the front desk (where you buy the admission ticket) to be your tour $T$. he/ she will explain more detail things about the museum. just give the tour $T$ idr20000 at the end of the tour..

"i would say i was expecting to find more hystorical value of jakarta when i stepped into this place.yes... i found some interesting showcases but not as much i expected.explanation on the showcases was not so informative, aircond was not enough to cool down the room, $T$ was not so well. i would say it is not very pleasant.it could have been better.."

made up of few connecting malls. house everything you need. must know where to look for it. connected to sheraton and fourpoints hotels. so convenient for hotel guests to get their daily needs. one improvement it should have is to get the directory installed. it may be there but we just could not locate it. moreover the $T$ near escalators seem not updated. a bit confusing though.wifi free for the mall members only..

"beautiful old colonial building, several bits-&-pieces of artefacts, some lovely old furniture on display. it is worth going into just to see the building & especially to see the dungeons out the back, but $T$ are very poorly displayed, so do not expect too much. tip: they ask you to change out of your shoes & into slippers (scuffs) to protect the floors. make sure take your slippers off when you walk down the stairs. i slipped & fell down the stairs because the scuffs are so slippery. did not break anything, but bruised myself badly. you are better off to walk barefoot.."

"tunjungan plaza (tp) is probably the biggest shopping centre in town. it started from just tp 1 and 2 when i was small, but now it is tp 6 already! tp is really a one stop shop, where you can find department stores like matahari, sogo, and all the fashion brands. also, a great variety of food choices, from indonesian food, japanese, american, chinese. love the new $T$ and shops in tp 6, the look is very modern. if you have not been to tp for a while, it is worth a visit to enjoy the new tp 6!."

Positive
"this museum, honestly, was a let down. first of all, since i came there during the late holidays, it was packed with people. i did not enjoy looking at anything just because there were too much people around me. secondly, the collection was also a let down. they have a spacious $T$ to have more artefacts, but they just had one cupboard on one side of the room, and something else over the other. you just did not learn much -- thank god the entrance fee was really cheap (idr 3.000 for college students). third, it was hot. i was not even expecting them to have much ac, but they are just basically very hot and stuffy.good thing about this museum is that a) its cheap and b) its very good for photography outside the museum building. they have a large yard in which we can rent bicycles and a lot of street vendors which sells cheap selfie sticks, t-shirts, and sunglasses."
rooms
Positive
"this is probably in the top ten of the biggest shopping mall in indonesia, if not asia. the plaza is separated into 5 or 6 sub-plaza, each with up to 6 or 7 floor. each sub-plaza has its own complete amenities that are replicated by the other sub-plaza. the food court in level 5 are worth checking out. incredible $T$, one can even say there are too many options to choose from.."

Positive
"the entry fee of 5000 is definitely worth even a quick walk through this old dutch governors office, which has many similarities with the dutch palace paleis op de dam.while i was there, the $T$ was closed unfortunately.inside on the right you find a small exhibition on the history of java.on the other side you find a exhibition of the colony history.it is nothing big and it is not always translated (correctly) but you get a good impression and there are friendly guides.."

the largest mall in surabaya. the toilets in every corner are very nice and the $T$ is plenty of choice.
parking lot

"i was ecstatic knowing a contemporary art museum is opening in jakarta, and when i paid a visit i was satisfied! there is a minor thing here and there about the parking access and minimum signage for the location but i will take this as a 'opening phase's flaws', hopefully everything is up and about the next time i visit.the $T$ was not too big but it was comfortable for showings, remembering there are not too many art pieces to be shown as we speak for the current exhibitions. i saw that there are floors and spaces which are not opened yet, hopefully they will have upcoming exhibitions, more variety and objects to enjoyed.ticketing system can be improved, i have not got my receipt from my last week's visit.."

Positive
"for a museum that is suppose to house the oldest multi-national company (voc- dutch east indes company), the museum is very poorly maintained and lack $T$ that are worth presenting . firstly, the rooms are rather dilapidated and poorly ventilated. agree that the entrance fee is only us$0.35 . perhaps the low entrance fees prevents proper maintenance from taking place . secondly, the $T$ are rather meaningless - everywhere in the museums there are tables, chairs and furniture that appears unique but commonly found in that part of the world . the narratives are also poorly presented and disjointed . place is good for a 30minutes and a stopover if visiting the old town but it ought not to be the main reason why you go to that part of jakarta .."

"this museum is unexpectedly great for indonesia. museums in indonesia usually are poorly funded and curated and basically falling apart due to neglect. however, this $T$ is well-curated and managed and it seems to have some financing behind it. plus they currently have a kusama exhibit which is fun and stunning, plus super instagramable. definitely get your tickets ahead of time - you can do so easily online. parking is easy. there is a starbucks at the main entrance and then a 1/15 coffee up on the ticketing level. nice gift shop as well.."

"i thought this museum might be the answer for a different approach to introduce art to the larger indonesian audience. i am not making a comparison to other museums especially art related museums in jakarta, but to sum up people’s experience; macan is merely a hype. it is very well built, well-marketed, well-funded but poorly $T$. if success is to bring a wide mass range of audiences to pay a lot of money and willing to queue patiently to take a selfie in front of yayoi kusama’s infinity room, instead of introducing the richly diverse of indonesian and world art and becomes a bridge to educate people, then macan has done its job.."
managed
Negative
"a lovely little museum that introduces you to the city’s history - from sunda kelapa to jayakarta to batavia and finally jakarta. while popular among indonesians, very few expats seem to go here, which is a pity.we asked if there was an english guide and were delighted to meet lulu, who took us on a great tour of the entire premises. as a jakarta local, her insights made the experience even more interesting! there is quite a lot of written $T$ in english, so you can also wander around on your own. yes, the displays need some work and better aircon would help. but if you adjust your expectations and go with an open mind, you will have a good time! (also, the ticket is only 5000 rupiyah.)."

museum macan is a modern art museum located in jakarta that offers art exhibition for those who enjoys art. the interior of the museum is very aestethic and modern. the museum offers different exhibitons in every 3 to 4 months. i personally enjoy spending time in the museum because it offers many interesting facts and details. every exhibition is different and it never fails to impress me every time i visit this place. the curators made an interesting choice of $T$ and artistic performance to keep up with the modern era and it proves that art is not boring..

""exhibits"" are strewn/ placed around without care and without an explanation to tell you what it is. paintings on the wall show damage (even found one with a hole in it). this is all due to the fact that there are no, or little, barriers between the public and the exhibits. little kids can touch everything and sit on centuries old chairs. lighting is poor. museum staff only at the entrance door and do not care what happens after you have paid your entrance fee. after you shuffle through the old building (it gets very busy with local tourists) you will end up in the ""courtyard"". note that if you are caucasian, the majority of the local tourists think you are part of the exhibit. anyway, back to the ""courtyard"", this ""courtyard"" is used by local families to sit, rest and eat, after which all garbage is dumped on the pavement. the highlight of the ""courtyard"" is that it also is the entrance to the semi underground cells/ dungeons. another disappointment. no lights inside and you just stare into a dark hole, wondering what it is you are actually expected to find there. in short, there are 2 conclusions to be made 1) the present ""management"" should all be fired 2) the proceeds of the entrance fees should be used to restore this once magnificent building to its former glory . recommended amount of time to spend inside: less than 15 minutes.."

"visited the museum on a wednesday night for yayoi kusama's exhibition. i used public transport to kebon jeruk transjakarta bus stop to reach the museum. i was really excited to finally see 3 of yayoi kusama's most sought after big intallations: infinity mirrored room, the spirit of the pumpkins, and dots obsession. arrived at museum entrance at 6.35 pm, upon arrival a friendly security officer informed me that the line for these 3 installations will be closed at 7 pm and adviced me to visit those 3 installations first. to my suprise, the museum was relatively quite that night and the line for the big installations moved pretty fast. i somehow managed to visit the 3 installations in less than 30 minutes. a streak that maybe hard to achieve during the museum peak hours at weekend. moreover, thanks to the lovely officer lady at dots obsession who told me that the line to obliteration room will be closed at 7.30 pm, i managed to visit that one too.visiting the museum during weekday means we can enjoy the artworks in peace without being disturb by people taking selfies with the artworks endlessly. giving us more space to appreciate the artworks with no hustle and bustle.i need to give credit to the staffs and security officers at $T$. they were friendly, helpful, courteous, nevertheless firm at the same time. i understand it as their effort to ensure the exhibition run smoothly and enjoyable for all of visitors.afterall, my first visit to $T$ is an impressive one. thank you $T$ for giving us who live in indonesia the chance to access high quality artworks.hopefully many more interesting arts will come in the near future.."

"museum fatahillah as known as the jakarta history museum or batavia museum is located in the heart of old batavia, right in south of fatahillah square. it was built in 1710 as the city hall of jakarta and opened as museum in 1974.there are 37 ornate rooms and cells beneath the front portico were used as dungeons, which function until 1846. pangeran diponegoro, untung suropati and cut nyak dhien recorded once imprisoned here.museum fatahillah has a collection of around 23,500 objects. the collection includes objects from the dutch east indies company, historic maps, paintings, ceramics, furnitures, and archeological objects from the prehistoric era such as ancient inscriptions and sword. the collections are divided into several rooms such as prehistoric jakarta room, tarumanegara room, jayakarta room, fatahillah room, sultan agung room, and mh thamrin room.the museum also contains a replica of the tugu inscription (the original being in the national museum) from the age of great king purnawarman, which is the evidence that the center of the kingdom of tarumanegara was located around the seaport of tanjung priok on the coast of jakarta. there is also a replica of the 16th century map of the portuguese padrao monument, a historical evidence of the ancient sunda kelapa harbor.but, too bad that when i went there, the museum was already full with a lot of visitors. that is why i am not really comfortable to see and examine each and every room. one thing for sure, since the renovation on 4q2014, every visitors must change their footwear with $T$. i think it was because they add parquet to cover the real floor. but too bad they give the visitor with random size of $T$. mine was too small back then...another thing that really bother me is the inaccessible of female prison that was located right under the museum fatahillah because the leak and flood.i always get shivers when i went to the backyard. i just thought that actually this is the place where the execution happened, and below the portico, there were low ceiling rooms with small window where the male prisoners detained.."
