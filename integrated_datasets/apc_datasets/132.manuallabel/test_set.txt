i had heard a lot about the plaza but no one told us that it is in 6 portions. incidentally we took a drop at no 1 and trust me it was awful. we entered in to food outlets and a few stores and wanted to go to the activity area and got the mall directory. went to the 5th floor in a conjested lift because only 1 was working and found out about the other parts of the mall. the wash room was pathetic with no water. came out and then went to $T$ which was a nice place and had the entrance toward s sheraton. if going there please get proper info and then go.

(even i am annoyed by the selfie-focus visitors :/ )some people may think that the ticket is pricey (their first show was idr 50k, kusama show idr 100k) but this is by far the cheapest kusama show you can get around the world! in singapore or brisbane at least it will cost you a minimum of usd 20/ticket. i mean, weekend cinema show in jakarta is idr 75k, so the difference is not a big deal.mind you, the queue is long. so i am not suggesting to come here on weekend (too many people, too many selfie-focus visitors). best to enjoy it on weekday during lunch time or afterwork (love it).i am thinking to join their memberships so i can visit the exhibition during the members -only preview!."

"museum fatahillah is located in the heart of kota tua (old city). this area still has strong colonial influence left by the dutch during their occupation. it can be seen mostly from the architecture of the building or houses in this area. just like the surrounding, inside the museum fatahillah itself are mostly furniture and artifacts from the occupation era. this place can give a little insight of what it was like living in a house of a dutch landlord back in the days. on the courtyard is where the things get interesting - as interesting as a run down museum could be. at the backyard, there is an interesting canon. at the end of this canon, there is a sculpture of a hand doing a very bad hand gesture (see photo attached). this canon is a symbol of fertility and it is believe that whom ever touch it can be fertile.another thing that is interesting is their water jail. the dutch built a dungeon about 1.5m high and they put all the female prisoners in it and then they filled the jail with water about waist deep. so all the prisoners died from hypothermia, cold weather and such.also in the courtyard, you can find the excitements. from trying different kinds of local $T$ (the $T$ is really really really good), riding on the old dutch bicycle, people selling different kinds of souvenirs. and at night, that is when everything comes to live. different kinds performances from street musicians, magic attractions, tattoo artists and many more.so, even though the upkeep of these place is not very good (just like any other public infrastructure) it is still a place that you should not miss when you are in town. if you are not going there for the museum itself, go there for the experience. to be in the middle of local people with such a diverse culture and tradition that i can guarantee is totally different from where you came from especially if you are coming from somewhere outside of south east asia :)."

"with its limited range of exhibits i would only recommend this museum to people interested in the history of the town when it was called batavia and under dutch rule. maps show the various stages of development and there is a decent collection of period dutch furniture. one of the bookcases is huge with an amazingly intricate carved headpiece. i read once about a 17th century french visitor to batavia who was bored by all the backgammon he saw being played - sure enough there is a beautifully carved backgammon $T$ on display. i enjoyed my visit to this museum, which helped to bring the past to life for me, but some people will probably race through it in minutes.."

well if you are dutch it is worth to see. but be aware most people are locals that go there in order to have some pictures with some old dutch furniture taken. the explanations of the museum are very poor. it is not suitable for $T$. you learn more on the history of the city at the museum bank indonesia for the same entrance fee..

"the museum itself was not worth it to go to, not unless you are a mega fanatic of history. it was plain boring with just puppets on display. there were some old instruments but basically that is it. the museum is not fully airconditioned so there were parts that were humid and some children were literally lying down on the museum floor while waiting for their next class or something. the souvenir shop at the doorway of the museum sells cheap handicrafts and the seller behind the counter has excellent customer service skill. if you are not a fan of puppets and clowns, not necessary to be in this museum. i for one, am afraid of clowns so i was pale the entire time.what is worth it though is the outside of the museum where a street market is. you can buy lots of things from slippers to accessories and food at a very cheap $T$.."

"i knew beforehand that this museum has its issues, but it was still tragic to see how the improper display and protection of pieces might lead to a part of indonesia's history being lost. broken pieces of furniture on display, dirty / dusty glass of display cabinets, holes in the beautiful wooden floor, improper / no / bad lighting, graffiti (??!!) on the double doors leading onto verandah upstairs; these are just some of the issues noted. some pieces are displayed haphazardly without the context being properly explained or the pieces being displayed are not in context and some seem unrelated to each other. all labels do not have english. not all pieces have labels or there is only a code. but many labels are informative. still worth a $T$; one learns a lot and there are some stunning pieces such as the huge wall divider upstairs and also the information on indonesia downstairs incl. various kingdoms, trade, implements, dress etc. beautifully wooden carved examples of boats, e.g. as was used by the portugese traders. the building itself is an architectual gem; i really hope more funds will be forthcoming; apparently renovations are supposed to take place? however, kota needs to be preserved as a whole. looking at other buildings in the area and renovations taking place, it does not seem if any preservation guidelines are being followed. kota overall is definitely worth a $T$.."

"museum fatahillah as known as the jakarta history museum or batavia museum is located in the heart of old batavia, right in south of fatahillah square. it was built in 1710 as the city hall of jakarta and opened as museum in 1974.there are 37 ornate rooms and cells beneath the front portico were used as dungeons, which function until 1846. pangeran diponegoro, untung suropati and cut nyak dhien recorded once imprisoned here.museum fatahillah has a collection of around 23,500 objects. the collection includes objects from the dutch east indies company, historic maps, paintings, ceramics, furnitures, and archeological objects from the prehistoric era such as ancient inscriptions and sword. the collections are divided into several rooms such as prehistoric jakarta room, tarumanegara room, jayakarta room, fatahillah room, sultan agung room, and mh thamrin room.the museum also contains a replica of the tugu inscription (the original being in the national museum) from the age of great king purnawarman, which is the evidence that the center of the kingdom of tarumanegara was located around the seaport of tanjung priok on the coast of jakarta. there is also a replica of the 16th century map of the portuguese padrao monument, a historical evidence of the ancient sunda kelapa harbor.but, too bad that when i went there, the museum was already full with a lot of $T$. that is why i am not really comfortable to see and examine each and every room. one thing for sure, since the renovation on 4q2014, every $T$ must change their footwear with slippers. i think it was because they add parquet to cover the real floor. but too bad they give the visitor with random size of slippers. mine was too small back then...another thing that really bother me is the inaccessible of female prison that was located right under the museum fatahillah because the leak and flood.i always get shivers when i went to the backyard. i just thought that actually this is the place where the execution happened, and below the portico, there were low ceiling rooms with small window where the male prisoners detained.."

"museum fatahillah is located in the heart of kota tua (old city). this area still has strong colonial influence left by the dutch during their occupation. it can be seen mostly from the architecture of the building or houses in this area. just like the surrounding, inside the museum fatahillah itself are mostly furniture and artifacts from the occupation era. this place can give a little insight of what it was like living in a house of a dutch landlord back in the days. on the $T$ is where the things get interesting - as interesting as a run down museum could be. at the backyard, there is an interesting canon. at the end of this canon, there is a sculpture of a hand doing a very bad hand gesture (see photo attached). this canon is a symbol of fertility and it is believe that whom ever touch it can be fertile.another thing that is interesting is their water jail. the dutch built a dungeon about 1.5m high and they put all the female prisoners in it and then they filled the jail with water about waist deep. so all the prisoners died from hypothermia, cold weather and such.also in the $T$, you can find the excitements. from trying different kinds of local food (the food is really really really good), riding on the old dutch bicycle, people selling different kinds of souvenirs. and at night, that is when everything comes to live. different kinds performances from street musicians, magic attractions, tattoo artists and many more.so, even though the upkeep of these place is not very good (just like any other public infrastructure) it is still a place that you should not miss when you are in town. if you are not going there for the museum itself, go there for the experience. to be in the middle of local people with such a diverse culture and tradition that i can guarantee is totally different from where you came from especially if you are coming from somewhere outside of south east asia :)."

for anyone who is used to european museums the expectation is nearly inevitably disappointed. the museum has some nice $T$ but nothing really spectacular. it seems that only few pieces remained from the colonial area and all of them made their way into this museum. so it does not really look like the top picks selected from a big portfolio. better spend your time opposite at the colonial style cafe..

"if you already tired with all modern busy city jakarta, try to visit this place once awhile. located in heart of jakarta and easily can be reached by transjakarta bus without transit if you take the bus from blok m terminal all the way to kota terminal. this building used to be a governor house office in olden time (year 1600). it got renovated in 2013 and changed from original old house display inside outside into museum display inside (which everything have boxes and they painted the wall with illustration and so on). truthfully, i prefer the old house display which show this house in its very original state with chairs, table, bed still stay in their old place which showed us the way of olden people living style. personally,that condition made me imagine what kind of activity they had in that house day by day in olden time. and re modelling it somehow made this $T$ disappear in my eye. well the structure itself still in original state and you still can see two kind of prison inside. this museum main attraction items are canons, sword that said to be an item to cut people head, hermes statue and antique furniture. it would be better if you hire a guide to explain everything inside or buy a book and sightseeing alone is okay too.in front of this building there are sepeda onthel (antique bicycle) for rent (sorry i forgot how much is the rent fee) with hat, a recommended batavia cafe (good spot to take photo, eat and relax), puppet museum (museum wayang) and ceramics museum. across the street you can find museum bank mandiri and museum bank indonesia which interesting too and those two are worth of visit. if you go along the path furthermore you can find beautiful old bridge that used to be an trading icon point since the river nearby was a main path for trade activity (it used wide and clear). near there stand an old building that used to be a storehouse and old lighthouse even though it is not in use anymore. for all of this you will need time from morning (around 10.00) till afternoon (around 15.00)."

"tunjungan plaza (tp) is probably the biggest shopping centre in town. it started from just tp 1 and 2 when i was small, but now it is tp 6 already! tp is really a one stop shop, where you can find department stores like matahari, sogo, and all the fashion brands. also, a great variety of food choices, from indonesian food, japanese, american, chinese. love the new food court and $T$ in tp 6, the look is very modern. if you have not been to tp for a while, it is worth a visit to enjoy the new tp 6!."

"for a museum that is suppose to house the oldest multi-national company (voc- dutch east indes company), the museum is very poorly maintained and lack $T$ that are worth presenting . firstly, the rooms are rather dilapidated and poorly ventilated. agree that the entrance fee is only us$0.35 . perhaps the low entrance fees prevents proper maintenance from taking place . secondly, the $T$ are rather meaningless - everywhere in the museums there are tables, chairs and furniture that appears unique but commonly found in that part of the world . the narratives are also poorly presented and disjointed . place is good for a 30minutes and a stopover if visiting the old town but it ought not to be the main reason why you go to that part of jakarta .."

museum
Positive
"museum fatahillah is located in the heart of kota tua (old city). this area still has strong colonial influence left by the dutch during their occupation. it can be seen mostly from the architecture of the building or houses in this area. just like the surrounding, inside the museum fatahillah itself are mostly furniture and artifacts from the occupation era. this place can give a little insight of what it was like living in a house of a dutch landlord back in the days. on the courtyard is where the things get interesting - as interesting as a run down museum could be. at the backyard, there is an interesting canon. at the end of this canon, there is a sculpture of a hand doing a very bad hand gesture (see photo attached). this canon is a symbol of fertility and it is believe that whom ever touch it can be fertile.another thing that is interesting is their water jail. the dutch built a dungeon about 1.5m high and they put all the female prisoners in it and then they filled the jail with water about waist deep. so all the prisoners died from hypothermia, cold weather and such.also in the courtyard, you can find the excitements. from trying different kinds of local food (the food is really really really good), riding on the old dutch bicycle, people selling different kinds of souvenirs. and at night, that is when everything comes to live. different kinds performances from street musicians, magic attractions, tattoo artists and many more.so, even though the $T$ of these place is not very good (just like any other public infrastructure) it is still a place that you should not miss when you are in town. if you are not going there for the museum itself, go there for the experience. to be in the middle of local people with such a diverse culture and tradition that i can guarantee is totally different from where you came from especially if you are coming from somewhere outside of south east asia :)."

"visited the $T$ on a wednesday night for yayoi kusama's exhibition. i used public transport to kebon jeruk transjakarta bus stop to reach the $T$. i was really excited to finally see 3 of yayoi kusama's most sought after big intallations: infinity mirrored room, the spirit of the pumpkins, and dots obsession. arrived at $T$ entrance at 6.35 pm, upon arrival a friendly security officer informed me that the line for these 3 installations will be closed at 7 pm and adviced me to visit those 3 installations first. to my suprise, the $T$ was relatively quite that night and the line for the big installations moved pretty fast. i somehow managed to visit the 3 installations in less than 30 minutes. a streak that maybe hard to achieve during the $T$ peak hours at weekend. moreover, thanks to the lovely officer lady at dots obsession who told me that the line to obliteration room will be closed at 7.30 pm, i managed to visit that one too.visiting the $T$ during weekday means we can enjoy the artworks in peace without being disturb by people taking selfies with the artworks endlessly. giving us more space to appreciate the artworks with no hustle and bustle.i need to give credit to the staffs and security officers at macan. they were friendly, helpful, courteous, nevertheless firm at the same time. i understand it as their effort to ensure the exhibition run smoothly and enjoyable for all of visitors.afterall, my first visit to macan is an impressive one. thank you macan for giving us who live in indonesia the chance to access high quality artworks.hopefully many more interesting arts will come in the near future.."

i just love kota tua - the old historical city if batavia. fatahillah square and it is adjacent buildings are magnificent. unfortunately jakarta sejarah museum is not up to scratch to international standards. the building is wonderful but the information you get is meagre. there is much room for improvement. also some of the renovations are rather uninspired. yet you can grasp how it was there 200 years ago. it is one of the few places where bule (foreigners) pay as much as locals: $T$ is only 5.000 idr ( 35 cents €).do not miss it. opposite the museum is café batavia where you can enjoy colonial style fine dining. to the right is the museum of modern arts. just try to soak in the atmosphere. it is worth it..

"museum fatahillah as known as the jakarta history museum or batavia museum is located in the heart of old batavia, right in south of fatahillah square. it was built in 1710 as the city hall of jakarta and opened as museum in 1974.there are 37 ornate rooms and cells beneath the front portico were used as dungeons, which function until 1846. pangeran diponegoro, untung suropati and cut nyak dhien recorded once imprisoned here.museum fatahillah has a collection of around 23,500 objects. the collection includes objects from the dutch east indies company, historic maps, paintings, ceramics, furnitures, and archeological objects from the prehistoric era such as ancient inscriptions and sword. the collections are divided into several rooms such as prehistoric jakarta room, tarumanegara room, jayakarta room, fatahillah room, sultan agung room, and mh thamrin room.the museum also contains a replica of the tugu inscription (the original being in the national museum) from the age of great king purnawarman, which is the evidence that the center of the kingdom of tarumanegara was located around the seaport of tanjung priok on the coast of jakarta. there is also a replica of the 16th century map of the portuguese padrao monument, a historical evidence of the ancient sunda kelapa harbor.but, too bad that when i went there, the museum was already full with a lot of visitors. that is why i am not really comfortable to see and examine each and every room. one thing for sure, since the renovation on 4q2014, every visitors must change their footwear with slippers. i think it was because they add parquet to cover the real floor. but too bad they give the visitor with random size of slippers. mine was too small back then...another thing that really bother me is the inaccessible of female $T$ that was located right under the museum fatahillah because the leak and flood.i always get shivers when i went to the backyard. i just thought that actually this is the place where the execution happened, and below the portico, there were low ceiling rooms with small window where the male prisoners detained.."

"the huge shopping complex was divided into six (you read it right) different sections, each catered to different market segments. they were named accordingly (tp1, tp2,.......tp6). each had eight floors of shops, food stands, cafés, restaurants and even a gym!tp1 catered more to middle to middle-low market with department store like matahari. at the lowest level (lg floor) there was a supermarket, although not a big one, but you can probably find what you are forgetting to bring in your amenities bag. one surprise find.. there was a salad shop called crunchaus. their salads were super good with many different choices of dressings. i got mine customized and the staffs were very accomodating, greatly recommended. tp2 had many muslim fashion shops and a big diy store that sold almost any home or kitchen related hardwares.tp3 was the largest section (i am going to) and it was skewed towards middle class market. you can find many famous brands like uniqlo, zara, sephora, victoria's secret, adidas, reebok and many more. being one of top producers of coffee in the world, coffee shops were on almost every floor, each had their own signature blend.if you are looking for more expensive branded items then tp4 would be your section. department store sogo, michael kors, tumi, coach, aigner, mango were all here.tp5 and tp6 were like extensions of tp4. many middle to middle-up shops and cafés were found here.tip: if you are hungry just head straight to fifth floor. the whole floor is all about food, literally. you can dine three meals a day with different choice each time and still have not exhausted all available $T$.."

"the jakarta history $T$ (also known as fatahillah $T$) is housed in the former city hall located in the old part of the city now known as jakarta kota, few hundred meters behind the port and warehouses of sunda kelapa. originally called the stadhuis, this building was the administrative headquarters of the dutch east india company, and later of the dutch government.goto packagesbuilt in 1710 by governor general van riebeeck, this solid building hides below it notorious dungeons and filthy water prisons. today, this $T$ displays the history of jakarta from prehistoric days to the founding of the town of jayakarta. the collection includes a replica of the tugu inscription that dates back to the 5th century under the reign of the great king purnawarman, evidence that the center of the tarumanegara kingdom was located around the present day seaport of tanjung priok. his collection reflects the influences of various cultural elements on the city of batavia, namely from europe, especially from the netherlands, from china and india as well as from indonesia itself.very disappointing that this $T$ is not well maintained. it is smelly and stuffy. aircon is not working or not tuning on at all! however, window remains closed and trapping air created not ventilation espc kay in this tropic weather! all the displays are able to be tougher by the visitors and really do not enjoy the walk as it is crowded with with picture taking , touching the antiques and displays... many local people here for photo taking and not to read and understand the culture. sadly this $T$ would become worst day by day. there would be no more history to tell with many others in the future.."

"this museum has a lot of potential. jakarta and indonesia as a whole have such a rich and extensive history. unfortunately, the layout of the exhibits was not chronological, and some artifacts did not have labels beside them to explain what they were. a few of the data graphs were low-resolution printouts found on the internet, and so they were quite blurry. some of the photographs in a couple of the exhibits were laid out poorly high up, and so it was hard to read the accompanying information while straining your neck to look up.despite its disorganization and poor layout, if you happen to be in fatahillah square, then i would recommend checking it out. it only costs 5000 idr ($0.33 usd) to enter, and all the $T$ very extremely friendly and pleasant, greeting you as you went from room to room. i did learn a few new things about jakarta that i did not know before.."

"if you already tired with all modern busy city jakarta, try to visit this place once awhile. located in heart of jakarta and easily can be reached by transjakarta bus without transit if you take the bus from blok m terminal all the way to kota terminal. this building used to be a governor house office in olden time (year 1600). it got renovated in 2013 and changed from original old house display inside outside into museum display inside (which everything have boxes and they painted the wall with illustration and so on). truthfully, i prefer the old house display which show this house in its very original state with chairs, table, bed still stay in their old place which showed us the way of olden people living style. personally,that condition made me imagine what kind of activity they had in that house day by day in olden time. and re modelling it somehow made this charm disappear in my eye. well the structure itself still in original state and you still can see two kind of prison inside. this museum main attraction items are canons, sword that said to be an item to cut people head, hermes statue and antique furniture. it would be better if you hire a guide to explain everything inside or buy a book and sightseeing alone is okay too.in front of this building there are sepeda onthel (antique bicycle) for rent (sorry i forgot how much is the rent fee) with hat, a recommended $T$ (good spot to take photo, eat and relax), puppet museum (museum wayang) and ceramics museum. across the street you can find museum bank mandiri and museum bank indonesia which interesting too and those two are worth of visit. if you go along the path furthermore you can find beautiful old bridge that used to be an trading icon point since the river nearby was a main path for trade activity (it used wide and clear). near there stand an old building that used to be a storehouse and old lighthouse even though it is not in use anymore. for all of this you will need time from morning (around 10.00) till afternoon (around 15.00)."

"first of all: this is not a ""museum"", full stop. it is a poorly restored, tired old building without ac. ""exhibits"" are strewn/ placed around without care and without an explanation to tell you what it is. paintings on the wall show damage (even found one with a hole in it). this is all due to the fact that there are no, or little, barriers between the public and the exhibits. little kids can touch everything and sit on centuries old chairs. $T$ is poor. museum staff only at the entrance door and do not care what happens after you have paid your entrance fee. after you shuffle through the old building (it gets very busy with local tourists) you will end up in the ""courtyard"". note that if you are caucasian, the majority of the local tourists think you are part of the exhibit. anyway, back to the ""courtyard"", this ""courtyard"" is used by local families to sit, rest and eat, after which all garbage is dumped on the pavement. the highlight of the ""courtyard"" is that it also is the entrance to the semi underground cells/ dungeons. another disappointment. no lights inside and you just stare into a dark hole, wondering what it is you are actually expected to find there. in short, there are 2 conclusions to be made 1) the present ""management"" should all be fired 2) the proceeds of the entrance fees should be used to restore this once magnificent building to its former glory . recommended amount of time to spend inside: less than 15 minutes.."

"the jakarta history $T$ (also known as fatahillah $T$) is housed in the former city hall located in the old part of the city now known as jakarta kota, few hundred meters behind the port and warehouses of sunda kelapa. originally called the stadhuis, this building was the administrative headquarters of the dutch east india company, and later of the dutch government.goto packagesbuilt in 1710 by governor general van riebeeck, this solid building hides below it notorious dungeons and filthy water prisons. today, this $T$ displays the history of jakarta from prehistoric days to the founding of the town of jayakarta. the collection includes a replica of the tugu inscription that dates back to the 5th century under the reign of the great king purnawarman, evidence that the center of the tarumanegara kingdom was located around the present day seaport of tanjung priok. his collection reflects the influences of various cultural elements on the city of batavia, namely from europe, especially from the netherlands, from china and india as well as from indonesia itself.very disappointing that this $T$ is not well maintained. it is smelly and stuffy. aircon is not working or not tuning on at all! however, window remains closed and trapping air created not ventilation espc kay in this tropic weather! all the displays are able to be tougher by the visitors and really do not enjoy the walk as it is crowded with with picture taking , touching the antiques and displays... many local people here for photo taking and not to read and understand the culture. sadly this $T$ would become worst day by day. there would be no more history to tell with many others in the future.."

"i knew beforehand that this museum has its issues, but it was still tragic to see how the improper $T$ and protection of pieces might lead to a part of indonesia's history being lost. broken pieces of furniture on $T$, dirty / dusty glass of $T$ cabinets, holes in the beautiful wooden floor, improper / no / bad lighting, graffiti (??!!) on the double doors leading onto verandah upstairs; these are just some of the issues noted. some pieces are displayed haphazardly without the context being properly explained or the pieces being displayed are not in context and some seem unrelated to each other. all labels do not have english. not all pieces have labels or there is only a code. but many labels are informative. still worth a visit; one learns a lot and there are some stunning pieces such as the huge wall divider upstairs and also the information on indonesia downstairs incl. various kingdoms, trade, implements, dress etc. beautifully wooden carved examples of boats, e.g. as was used by the portugese traders. the building itself is an architectual gem; i really hope more funds will be forthcoming; apparently renovations are supposed to take place? however, kota needs to be preserved as a whole. looking at other buildings in the area and renovations taking place, it does not seem if any preservation guidelines are being followed. kota overall is definitely worth a visit.."

"hopefully, this museum have many more infinity room (it was amazing art and place), just manage your trick to take a photo there (you have only 45 seconds), actually it is a gorgeous museum i ever visit in jakarta, i really like with the program, arts, architecture, souvenir, i feel indonesia is amazing and smart country with good personality. i enjoy the $T$ there with jakarta landscape view (west jakarta). and i felt in love with museum timeline when i visit ""art turns, world turns, world turns"". bring your family, parent, or friends to come here and keep in touch with new idea and art here. but is not cheap, i think it is best price for the best experience.."
